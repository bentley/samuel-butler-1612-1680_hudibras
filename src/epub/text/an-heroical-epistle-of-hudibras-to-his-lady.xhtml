				<h3 epub:type="title">An Heroical Epistle of Hudibras to His Lady</h3>
<p id="id00616" style="margin-top: 2em">I who was once as great as CAESAR,<br/>

Am now reduc'd to NEBUCHADNEZZAR;<br/>

And from as fam'd a conqueror<br/>

As ever took degree in war,<br/>

Or did his exercise in battle,                                  5<br/>

By you turn'd out to grass with cattle:<br/>

For since I am deny'd access<br/>

To all my earthly happiness<br/>

Am fallen from the paradise<br/>

Of your good graces, and fair eyes;                            10<br/>

Lost to the world, and you, I'm sent<br/>

To everlasting banishment;<br/>

Where all the hopes I had t' have won<br/>

Your heart, b'ing dash'd, will break my own.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00617">Yet if you were not so severe                                  15<br/>

To pass your doom before you hear,<br/>

You'd find, upon my just defence,<br/>

How much y' have wrong'd my innocence.<br/>

That once I made a vow to you,<br/>

Which yet is unperformed, 'tis true:                           20<br/>

But not because it is unpaid,<br/>

'Tis violated, though delay'd;<br/>

Or, if it were, it is no fau't,<br/>

So heinous as you'd have it thought;<br/>

To undergo the loss of ears,                                   25<br/>

Like vulgar hackney perjurers<br/>

For there's a diff'rence in the case,<br/>

Between the noble and the base,<br/>

Who always are observ'd t' have done't<br/>

Upon as different an account:                                  30<br/>

The one for great and weighty cause,<br/>

To salve in honour ugly flaws;<br/>

For none are like to do it sooner<br/>

Than those who are nicest of their honour:<br/>

The other, for base gain and pay,                              35<br/>

Forswear, and perjure by the day;<br/>

And make th' exposing and retailing<br/>

Their souls and consciences a calling.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00618">It is no scandal, nor aspersion,<br/>

Upon a great and noble person,                                 40<br/>

To say he nat'rally abhorr'd<br/>

Th' old-fashion'd trick, To keep his word;<br/>

Though 'tis perfidiousness and shame<br/>

In meaner men to do the same:<br/>

For to be able to forget,                                      45<br/>

Is found more useful to the great,<br/>

Than gout, or deafness, or bad eyes,<br/>

To make 'em pass for wond'rous wise.<br/>

But though the law on perjurers<br/>

Inflicts the forfeiture of ears,                               50<br/>

It is not just that does exempt<br/>

The guilty, and punish th' innocent;<br/>

To make the ears repair the wrong<br/>

Committed by th' ungovern'd tongue;<br/>

And when one member is forsworn,                               55<br/>

Another to be cropt or torn.<br/>

And if you shou'd, as you design,<br/>

By course of law, recover mine,<br/>

You're like, if you consider right,<br/>

To gain but little honour by't.                                60<br/>

For he that for his lady's sake<br/>

Lays down his life or limbs at stake,<br/>

Does not so much deserve her favour,<br/>

As he that pawns his soul to have her,<br/>

This y' have acknowledg'd I have done,                         65<br/>

Although you now disdain to own;<br/>

But sentence what you rather ought<br/>

T' esteem good service than a fau't.<br/>

Besides, oaths are not bound to bear<br/>

That literal sense the words infer,                            70<br/>

But, by the practice of the age,<br/>

Are to be judg'd how far th' engage;<br/>

And, where the sense by custom's checkt,<br/>

Are found void, and of none effect.<br/>

For no man takes or keeps a vow                                75<br/>

But just as he sees others do;<br/>

Nor are th' oblig'd to be so brittle,<br/>

As not to yield and bow a little:<br/>

For as best-temper'd blades are found,<br/>

Before they break, to bend quite round,                        80<br/>

So truest oaths are still most tough,<br/>

And though they bow, are breaking proof.<br/>

Then wherefore should they not b' allow'd<br/>

In love a greater latitude?<br/>

For as the law of arms approves                                85<br/>

All ways to conquest, so should love's;<br/>

And not be ty'd to true or false,<br/>

But make that justest that prevails<br/>

For how can that which is above<br/>

All empire, high and mighty love,                              90<br/>

Submit its great prerogative<br/>

To any other power alive?<br/>

Shall love, that to no crown gives place,<br/>

Become the subject of a case?<br/>

The fundamental law of nature,                                 95<br/>

Be over-rul'd by those made after?<br/>

Commit the censure of its cause<br/>

To any but its own great laws?<br/>

Love, that's the world's preservative,                        100<br/>

That keeps all souls of things alive;<br/>

Controuls the mighty pow'r of fate,<br/>

And gives mankind a longer date;<br/>

The life of nature, that restores<br/>

As fast as time and death devours;<br/>

To whose free-gift the world does owe,                        105<br/>

Not only earth, but heaven too;<br/>

For love's the only trade that's driven,<br/>

The interest of state in heav'n,<br/>

Which nothing but the soul of man<br/>

Is capable to entertain.                                      110<br/>

For what can earth produce, but love<br/>

To represent the joys above?<br/>

Or who but lovers can converse,<br/>

Like angels, by &lt;e&gt; the eye-discourse?<br/>

Address and compliment by vision;                             115<br/>

Make love and court by intuition?<br/>

And burn in amorous flames as fierce<br/>

As those celestial ministers?<br/>

Then how can any thing offend,<br/>

In order to so great an end?                                  120<br/>

Or heav'n itself a sin &lt;f&gt; resent,<br/>

That for its own supply was meant?<br/>

That merits, in a kind mistake,<br/>

A pardon for th' offence's sake.<br/>

Or if it did not, but the cause                               125<br/>

Were left to th' injury at laws,<br/>

What tyranny can disapprove<br/>

There should be equity in love;<br/>

For laws that are inanimate,<br/>

And feel no sense of love or hate,                            130<br/>

That have no passion of their own,<br/>

Nor pity to be wrought upon,<br/>

Are only proper to inflict<br/>

Revenge on criminals as strict<br/>

But to have power to forgive,                                 135<br/>

Is empire and prerogative;<br/>

And 'tis in crowns a nobler gem<br/>

To grant a pardon than condemn.<br/>

Then since so few do what they ought,<br/>

'Tis great t' indulge a well-meant fau't.                     140<br/>

For why should he who made address,<br/>

All humble ways, without success,<br/>

And met with nothing, in return,<br/>

But insolence, affronts, and scorn,<br/>

Not strive by wit to countermine,                             145<br/>

And bravely carry his design?<br/>

He who was us'd so unlike a soldier,<br/>

Blown up with philters of love-powder?<br/>

And after letting blood, and purging,<br/>

Condemn'd to voluntary scourging;                             150<br/>

Alarm'd with many a horrid fright,<br/>

And claw'd by goblins in the night;<br/>

Insulted on, revil'd, and jeer'd,<br/>

With rude invasion of his beard;<br/>

And when your sex was foully scandal'd,                       155<br/>

As foully by the rabble handled;<br/>

Attack'd by despicable foes,<br/>

And drub'd with mean and vulgar blows;<br/>

And, after all, to be debarr'd<br/>

So much as standing on his guard;                             160<br/>

When horses, being spurr'd and prick'd,<br/>

Have leave to kick for being kick'd?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00619">Or why should you, whose mother-wits<br/>

Are furnish'd with all perquisites,<br/>

That with your breeding-teeth begin,                          165<br/>

And nursing babies, that lie in,<br/>

B' allow'd to put all tricks upon<br/>

Our cully sex, and we use none?<br/>

We, who have nothing but frail vows<br/>

Against your stratagems t' oppose;                            170<br/>

Or oaths more feeble than your own,<br/>

By which we are no less put down?<br/>

You wound, like &lt;g&gt; Parthians, while you fly,<br/>

And kill with a retreating eye:<br/>

Retire the more, the more we press                            175<br/>

To draw us into ambushes.<br/>

As pirates all false colours wear<br/>

T' intrap th' unwary mariner,<br/>

So women, to surprise us, spread<br/>

The borrow'd flags of white and red;                          180<br/>

Display 'em thicker on their cheeks<br/>

Than their old grandmothers, the Picts;<br/>

And raise more devils with their looks,<br/>

Than conjurer's less subtle books;<br/>

Lay trains of amorous intrigues,                              185<br/>

In tow'rs, and curls, and perriwigs,<br/>

With greater art and cunning rear'd,<br/>

Than &lt;h&gt; PHILIP NYE's thanksgiving beard,<br/>

Prepost'rously t' entice, and gain<br/>

Those to adore 'em they disdain;                              190<br/>

And only draw 'em in, to clog<br/>

With idle names a catalogue.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00620">A lover is, the more he's brave,<br/>

T' his mistress but the more a slave;<br/>

And whatsoever she commands,                                  195<br/>

Becomes a favour from her hands;<br/>

Which he's obliged t' obey, and must,<br/>

Whether it be unjust or just.<br/>

Then when he is compell'd by her<br/>

T' adventures he would else forbear,                          200<br/>

Who with his honour can withstand,<br/>

Since force is greater than command?<br/>

And when necessity's obey'd,<br/>

Nothing can be unjust or bad<br/>

And therefore when the mighty pow'rs                          205<br/>

Of love, our great ally and yours,<br/>

Join'd forces not to be withstood<br/>

By frail enamour'd flesh and blood,<br/>

All I have done, unjust or ill,<br/>

Was in obedience to your will;                                210<br/>

And all the blame that can be due,<br/>

Falls to your cruelty and you.<br/>

Nor are those scandals I confest,<br/>

Against my will and interest,<br/>

More than is daily done of course                             215<br/>

By all men, when they're under force;<br/>

When some upon the rack confess<br/>

What th' hangman and their prompters please;<br/>

But are no sooner out of pain,<br/>

Than they deny it all again.                                  220<br/>

But when the Devil turns confessor,<br/>

Truth is a crime he takes no pleasure<br/>

To hear, or pardon, like the founder<br/>

Of liars, whom they all claim under<br/>

And therefore, when I told him none,                          225<br/>

I think it was the wiser done.<br/>

Nor am I without precedent,<br/>

The first that on th' adventure went<br/>

All mankind ever did of course,<br/>

And daily dues the same, or worse.                            230<br/>

For what romance can show a lover,<br/>

That had a lady to recover,<br/>

And did not steer a nearer course,<br/>

To fall a-board on his amours?<br/>

And what at first was held a crime,                           235<br/>

Has turn'd to honourable in time.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00621">To what a height did &lt;i&gt; infant ROME,<br/>

By ravishing of women, come<br/>

When men upon their spouses seiz'd,<br/>

And freely marry'd where they pleas'd,                        240<br/>

They ne'er forswore themselves, nor ly'd.<br/>

Nor, in the mind they were in, dy'd;<br/>

Nor took the pains t' address and sue,<br/>

Nor play'd the masquerade to woo;<br/>

Disdain'd to stay for friends' consents;                      245<br/>

Nor juggled about settlements:<br/>

Did need no license, nor no priest,<br/>

Nor friends, nor kindred, to assist;<br/>

Nor lawyers, to join land and money<br/>

In th' holy state of matrimony,                               250<br/>

Before they settled hands and hearts,<br/>

Till &lt;k&gt; alimony or death them parts:<br/>

Nor wou'd endure to stay until<br/>

Th' had got the very bride's good will;<br/>

But took a wise and shorter course                            255<br/>

To win the ladies, downright force.<br/>

And justly made 'em prisoners then,<br/>

As they have often since, us men,<br/>

With acting plays, and dancing jigs,<br/>

The luckiest of all love's intrigues;                         260<br/>

And when they had them at their pleasure,<br/>

Then talk'd of love and flames at leisure;<br/>

For after matrimony's over,<br/>

He that holds out but half a lover,<br/>

Deserves for ev'ry minute more                                265<br/>

Than half a year of love before;<br/>

For which the dames in contemplation<br/>

Of that best way of application,<br/>

Prov'd nobler wives than e'er was known,<br/>

By suit or treaty to be won;                                  270<br/>

And such as all posterity<br/>

Cou'd never equal nor come nigh.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00622">For women first were made for men,<br/>

Not men for them. — It follows, then,<br/>

That men have right to ev'ry one,                             275<br/>

And they no freedom of their own<br/>

And therefore men have pow'r to chuse,<br/>

But they no charter to refuse.<br/>

Hence 'tis apparent, that what course<br/>

Soe'er we take to your amours,                                280<br/>

Though by the indirectest way,<br/>

'Tis no injustice, nor foul play;<br/>

And that you ought to take that course,<br/>

As we take you, for better or worse;<br/>

And gratefully submit to those                                285<br/>

Who you, before another, chose.<br/>

For why should ev'ry savage beast<br/>

Exceed his great lord's interest?<br/>

Have freer pow'r than he in grace,<br/>

And nature, o'er the creature has?                            290<br/>

Because the laws he since has made<br/>

Have cut off all the pow'r he had;<br/>

Retrench'd the absolute dominion<br/>

That nature gave him over women;<br/>

When all his pow'r will not extend                            295<br/>

One law of nature to suspend;<br/>

And but to offer to repeal<br/>

The smallest clause, is to rebel.<br/>

This, if men rightly understood<br/>

Their privilege, they wou'd make good;                        300<br/>

And not, like sots, permit their wives<br/>

T' encroach on their prerogatives;<br/>

For which sin they deserve to be<br/>

Kept, as they are, in slavery:<br/>

And this some precious Gifted Teachers,                       305<br/>

Unrev'rently reputed leachers,<br/>

And disobey'd in making love,<br/>

Have vow'd to all the world to prove,<br/>

And make ye suffer, as you ought,<br/>

For that uncharitable fau't.                                  310<br/>

But I forget myself, and rove<br/>

Beyond th' instructions of my love.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00623">Forgive me (Fair) and only blame<br/>

Th' extravagancy of my flame,<br/>

Since 'tis too much at once to show                           315<br/>

Excess of love and temper too.<br/>

All I have said that's bad and true,<br/>

Was never meant to aim at you,<br/>

Who have so sov'reign a controul<br/>

O'er that poor slave of yours, my soul,                       320<br/>

That, rather than to forfeit you,<br/>

Has ventur'd loss of heaven too:<br/>

Both with an equal pow'r possest,<br/>

To render all that serve you blest:<br/>

But none like him, who's destin'd either                      325<br/>

To have, or lose you, both together.<br/>

And if you'll but this fault release<br/>

(For so it must be, since you please)<br/>

I'll pay down all that vow, and more,<br/>

Which you commanded, and I swore,                             330<br/>

And expiate upon my skin<br/>

Th' arrears in full of all my sin.<br/>

For 'tis but just that I should pay<br/>

Th' accruing penance for delay,<br/>

Which shall be done, until it move                            335<br/>

Your equal pity and your love.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00624">The Knight, perusing this Epistle,<br/>

Believ'd h' had brought her to his whistle;<br/>

And read it like a jocund lover,<br/>

With great applause t' himself, twice over;                   340<br/>

Subscrib'd his name, but at a fit<br/>

And humble distance to his wit;<br/>

And dated it with wond'rous art,<br/>

Giv'n from the bottom of his heart;<br/>

Then seal'd it with his Coat of Love,                         345<br/>

A smoaking faggot — and above,<br/>

Upon a scroll — I burn, and weep;<br/>

And near it — For her Ladyship;<br/>

Of all her sex most excellent,<br/>

These to her gentle hands present.                            350<br/>

Then gave it to his faithful Squire,<br/>

With lessons how t' observe and eye her.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00625">She first consider'd which was better,<br/>

To send it back, or burn the letter.<br/>

But guessing that it might import,                            355<br/>

Though nothing else, at least her sport,<br/>

She open'd it, and read it out,<br/>

With many a smile and leering flout:<br/>

Resolv'd to answer it in kind,<br/>

And thus perform'd what she design'd.                         360<br/>

began to consider, that, without propagation, it would soon be
destitute of inhabitants, he invented several fine shows, and

when they had them secure, they ravished them; from whence
proceeded so numerous an offspring.</p>
