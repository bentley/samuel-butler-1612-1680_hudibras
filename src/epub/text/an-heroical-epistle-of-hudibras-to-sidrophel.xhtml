<p id="id00394">WELL! SIDROPHEL, though 'tis in vain<br/>

To tamper with your crazy brain,<br/>

Without trepanning of your skull<br/>

As often as the moon's at full<br/>

'Tis not amiss, e're y' are giv'n o'er,                         5<br/>

To try one desp'rate med'cine more<br/>

For where your case can be no worse,<br/>

The desp'rat'st is the wisest course.<br/>

Is't possible that you, whose ears<br/>

Are of the tribe of Issachar's,                                10<br/>

And might (with equal reason) either,<br/>

For merit, or extent of leather,<br/>

With WILLIAM PRYN'S, before they were<br/>

Retrench'd and crucify'd, compare,<br/>

Shou'd yet be deaf against a noise                             15<br/>

So roaring as the publick voice<br/>

That speaks your virtues free, and loud,<br/>

And openly, in ev'ry crowd,<br/>

As, loud as one that sings his part<br/>

T' a wheel-barrow or turnip-cart,                              20<br/>

Or your new nick-nam'd old invention<br/>

To cry green-hastings with an engine;<br/>

(As if the vehemence had stunn'd,<br/>

And turn your drum-heads with the sound;)<br/>

And 'cause your folly's now no news,                           25<br/>

But overgrown, and out of use,<br/>

Persuade yourself there's no such matter,<br/>

But that 'tis vanish'd out of nature;<br/>

When folly, as it grows in years,<br/>

The more extravagant appears;                                  30<br/>

For who but you could be possest<br/>

With so much ignorance, and beast,<br/>

That neither all mens' scorn and hate,<br/>

Nor being laugh'd and pointed at,<br/>

Nor bray'd so often in a mortar,                               35<br/>

Can teach you wholesome sense and nurture;<br/>

But (like a reprobate) what course<br/>

Soever's us'd, grow worse and worse<br/>

Can no transfusion of the blood,<br/>

That makes fools cattle, do you good?                          40<br/>

Nor putting pigs t' a bitch to nurse,<br/>

To turn 'em into mungrel-curs,<br/>

Put you into a way, at least,<br/>

To make yourself a better beast?<br/>

Can all your critical intrigues                                45<br/>

Of trying sound from rotten eggs;<br/>

Your several new-found remedies<br/>

Of curing wounds and scabs in trees;<br/>

Your arts of flexing them for claps,<br/>

And purging their infected saps;                               50<br/>

Recov'ring shankers, crystallines,<br/>

And nodes and botches in their rinds,<br/>

Have no effect to operate<br/>

Upon that duller block, your pate?<br/>

But still it must be lewdly bent                               55<br/>

To tempt your own due punishment;<br/>

And, like your whymsy'd chariots, draw,<br/>

The boys to course you without law;<br/>

As if the art you have so long<br/>

Profess'd, of making old dogs young,                           60<br/>

In you had virtue to renew<br/>

Not only youth, but childhood too.<br/>

Can you that understand all books,<br/>

By judging only with your looks,<br/>

Resolve all problems with your face,                           65<br/>

As others do with B's and A's;<br/>

Unriddle all that mankind knows<br/>

With solid bending of your brows;<br/>

All arts and sciences advance,<br/>

With screwing of your countenance,                             70<br/>

And, with a penetrating eye,<br/>

Into th' abstrusest learning pry?<br/>

Know more of any trade b' a hint;<br/>

Than those that have been bred up in't;<br/>

And yet have no art, true or false,                            75<br/>

To help your own bad naturals;<br/>

But still, the more you strive t' appear,<br/>

Are found to be the wretcheder<br/>

For fools are known by looking wise,<br/>

As men find woodcocks by their eyes.                           80<br/>

Hence 'tis that 'cause y' have gain'd o' th' college<br/>

A quarter share (at most) of knowledge,<br/>

And brought in none, but spent repute,<br/>

Y' assume a pow'r as absolute<br/>

To judge, and censure, and controll,                           85<br/>

As if you were the sole Sir Poll;<br/>

And saucily pretend to know<br/>

More than your dividend comes to.<br/>

You'll find the thing will not be done<br/>

With ignorance and face alone                                  90<br/>

No, though y' have purchas'd to your name,<br/>

In history, so great a fame;<br/>

That now your talents, so well<br/>

For having all belief out-grown,<br/>

That ev'ry strange prodigious tale                             95<br/>

Is measur'd by your German scale;<br/>

By which the virtuosi try<br/>

The magnitude of ev'ry lye,<br/>

Cast up to what it does amount,<br/>

And place the bigg'st to your account?                        100<br/>

That all those stories that are laid<br/>

Too truly to you, and those made,<br/>

Are now still charg'd upon your score,<br/>

And lesser authors nam'd no more.<br/>

Alas! that faculty betrays                                    105<br/>

Those soonest it designs to raise;<br/>

And all your vain renown will spoil,<br/>

As guns o'ercharg'd the more recoil.<br/>

Though he that has but impudence,<br/>

To all things has a fair pretence;                            110<br/>

And put among his wants but shame,<br/>

To all the world may lay his claim:<br/>

Though you have try'd that nothing's borne<br/>

With greater ease than public scorn,<br/>

That all affronts do still give place                         115<br/>

To your impenetrable face,<br/>

That makes your way through all affairs,<br/>

As pigs through hedges creep with theirs;<br/>

Yet as 'tis counterfeit, and brass,<br/>

You must not think 'twill always pass;                        120<br/>

For all impostors, when they're known,<br/>

Are past their labour, and undone.<br/>

And all the best that can befal<br/>

An artificial natural,<br/>

Is that which madmen find as soon                             125<br/>

As once they're broke loose from the moon,<br/>

And, proof against her influence,<br/>

Relapse to e'er so little sense,<br/>

To turn stark fools, and subjects fit<br/>

For sport of boys, and rabble-wit.                            130<br/>
