<p>When civil dudgeon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> first grew high,<br/>

And men fell out they knew not why?<br/>

When hard words, jealousies, and fears,<br/>

Set folks together by the ears,<br/>

And made them fight, like mad or drunk,                         5<br/>

For Dame Religion, as for punk;<br/>

Whose honesty they all durst swear for,<br/>

Though not a man of them knew wherefore:<br/>

When Gospel-Trumpeter, surrounded<br/>

With long-ear'd rout, to battle sounded,                       10<br/>

And pulpit, drum ecclesiastick,<br/>

Was beat with fist, instead of a stick;<br/>

Then did Sir Knight abandon dwelling,<br/>

And out he rode a colonelling.<br/>

A wight he was, whose very sight wou'd                         15<br/>

Entitle him Mirror of Knighthood;<br/>

That never bent his stubborn knee<br/>

To any thing but Chivalry;<br/>

Nor put up blow, but that which laid<br/>

Right worshipful on shoulder-blade;                            20<br/>

Chief of domestic knights and errant,<br/>

Either for cartel or for warrant;<br/>

Great on the bench, great in the saddle,<br/>

That could as well bind o'er, as swaddle;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a><br/>

Mighty he was at both of these,                                25<br/>

And styl'd of war, as well as peace.<br/>

(So some rats, of amphibious nature,<br/>

Are either for the land or water).<br/>

But here our authors make a doubt<br/>

Whether he were more wise, or stout:                           30<br/>

Some hold the one, and some the other;<br/>

But howsoe'er they make a pother,<br/>

The diff'rence was so small, his brain<br/>

Outweigh'd his rage but half a grain;<br/>

Which made some take him for a tool                            35<br/>

That knaves do work with, call'd a fool,<br/>

And offer to lay wagers that<br/>

As MONTAIGNE, playing with his cat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a><br/>

Complains she thought him but an ass,<br/>

Much more she wou'd Sir HUDIBRAS;                              40<br/>

(For that's the name our valiant knight<br/>

To all his challenges did write).<br/>

But they're mistaken very much,<br/>

'Tis plain enough he was no such;<br/>

We grant, although he had much wit,                            45<br/>

H' was very shy of using it;<br/>

As being loth to wear it out,<br/>

And therefore bore it not about,<br/>

Unless on holy-days, or so,<br/>

As men their best apparel do.                                  50<br/>

Beside, 'tis known he could speak GREEK<br/>

As naturally as pigs squeek;<br/>

That LATIN was no more difficile,<br/>

Than to a blackbird 'tis to whistle:<br/>

Being rich in both, he never scanted                           55<br/>

His bounty unto such as wanted;<br/>

But much of either would afford<br/>

To many, that had not one word.<br/>

For Hebrew roots, although they're found<br/>

To flourish most in barren ground,                             60<br/>

He had such plenty, as suffic'd<br/>

To make some think him circumcis'd;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a><br/>

And truly so,  he was, perhaps,<br/>

Not as a proselyte, but for claps.<br/>
</p>

<p>He was in LOGIC a great critic,                                65<br/>

Profoundly skill'd in analytic;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a><br/>

He could distinguish, and divide<br/>

A hair 'twixt south, and south-west side:<br/>

On either which he would dispute,<br/>

Confute, change hands, and still confute,                      70<br/>

He'd undertake to prove, by force<br/>

Of argument, a man's no horse;<br/>

He'd prove a buzzard is no fowl,<br/>

And that a lord may be an owl,<br/>

A calf an alderman, a goose a justice,                         75<br/>

And rooks Committee-men and Trustees.<br/>

He'd run in debt by disputation,<br/>

And pay with ratiocination.<br/>

All this by syllogism, true<br/>

In mood and figure, he would do.                               80<br/>

For RHETORIC, he could not ope<br/>

His mouth, but out there flew a trope;<br/>

And when he happen'd to break off<br/>

I' th' middle of his speech, or cough,<br/>

H' had hard words,ready to show why,                           85<br/>

And tell what rules he did it by;<br/>

Else, when with greatest art he spoke,<br/>

You'd think he talk'd like other folk,<br/>

For all a rhetorician's rules<br/>

Teach nothing but to name his tools.                           90<br/>

His ordinary rate of speech<br/>

In loftiness of sound was rich;<br/>

A Babylonish dialect,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a><br/>

Which learned pedants much affect.<br/>

It was a parti-colour'd dress                                  95<br/>

Of patch'd and pie-bald languages;<br/>

'Twas English cut on Greek and Latin,<br/>

Like fustian heretofore on satin;<br/>

It had an odd promiscuous tone,<br/>

As if h' had talk'd three parts in one;                       100<br/>

Which made some think, when he did gabble,<br/>

Th' had heard three labourers of Babel;<br/>

Or CERBERUS himself pronounce<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a><br/>

A leash of languages at once.<br/>

This he as volubly would vent                                 105<br/>

As if his stock would ne'er be spent:<br/>

And truly, to support that charge,<br/>

He had supplies as vast and large;<br/>

For he cou'd coin, or counterfeit<br/>

New words, with little or no wit:                             110<br/>

Words so debas'd and hard, no stone<br/>

Was hard enough to touch them on;<br/>

And when with hasty noise he spoke 'em,<br/>

The ignorant for current took 'em;<br/>

That had the orator, who once<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a>                             115<br/>

Did fill his mouth with pebble stones<br/>

When he harangu'd, but known his phrase<br/>

He would have us'd no other ways.<br/>

In MATHEMATICKS he was greater<br/>

Than TYCHO BRAHE,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> or ERRA PATER:                          120<br/>

For he, by geometric scale,<br/>

Could take the size of pots of ale;<br/>

Resolve, by sines and tangents straight,<br/>

If bread or butter wanted weight,<br/>

And wisely tell what hour o' th' day                          125<br/>

The clock does strike by algebra.<br/>

Beside, he was a shrewd PHILOSOPHER,<br/>

And had read ev'ry text and gloss over;<br/>

Whate'er the crabbed'st author hath,<br/>

He understood b' implicit faith:                              130<br/>

Whatever sceptic could inquire for,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a><br/>

For ev'ry why he had a wherefore;<br/>

Knew more than forty of them do,<br/>

As far as words and terms cou'd go.<br/>

All which he understood by rote,                              135<br/>

And, as occasion serv'd, would quote;<br/>

No matter whether right or wrong,<br/>

They might be either said or sung.<br/>

His notions fitted things so well,<br/>

That which was which he could not tell;                       140<br/>

But oftentimes mistook th' one<br/>

For th' other, as great clerks have done.<br/>

He could reduce all things to acts,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a><br/>

And knew their natures by abstracts;<br/>

Where entity and quiddity,                                    145<br/>

The ghosts of defunct bodies fly;<br/>

Where truth in person does appear,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a><br/>

Like words congeal'd in northern air.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a><br/>

He knew what's what, and that's as high<br/>

As metaphysic wit can fly;                                    150<br/>

In school-divinity as able<br/>

As he that hight, Irrefragable;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a><br/>

A second THOMAS, or, at once,<br/>

To name them all, another DUNCE:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a><br/>

Profound in all the Nominal                                   155<br/>

And Real ways, beyond them all:<br/>

For he a rope of sand cou'd twist<br/>

As tough as learned SORBONIST;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a><br/>

And weave fine cobwebs, fit for skull<br/>

That's empty when the moon is full;                           160<br/>

Such as take lodgings in a head<br/>

That's to be let unfurnished.<br/>

He could raise scruples dark and nice,<br/>

And after solve 'em in a trice;<br/>

As if Divinity had catch'd                                    165<br/>

The itch, on purpose to be scratch'd;<br/>

Or, like a mountebank, did wound<br/>

And stab herself with doubts profound,<br/>

Only to show with how small pain<br/>

The sores of Faith are cur'd again;                           170<br/>

Although by woeful proof we find,<br/>

They always leave a scar behind.<br/>

He knew the seat of Paradise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a><br/>

Could tell in what degree it lies;<br/>

And, as he was dispos'd, could prove it,                      175<br/>

Below the moon, or else above it.<br/>

What Adam dreamt of, when his bride<br/>

Came from her closet in his side:<br/>

Whether the devil tempted her<br/>

By a High Dutch interpreter;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a>                              180<br/>

If either of them had a navel:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a><br/>

Who first made music malleable:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a><br/>

Whether the serpent, at the fall,<br/>

Had cloven feet, or none at all.<br/>

All this, without a gloss, or comment,                        185<br/>

He could unriddle in a moment,<br/>

In proper terms, such as men smatter<br/>

When they throw out, and miss the matter.<br/>
</p>

<p>For his Religion, it was fit<br/>

To match his learning and his wit;                            190<br/>

'Twas Presbyterian true blue;<br/>

For he was of that stubborn crew<br/>

Of errant saints, whom all men grant<br/>

To be the true Church Militant;<br/>

Such as do build their faith upon                             195<br/>

The holy text of pike and gun;<br/>

Decide all controversies by<br/>

Infallible artillery;<br/>

And prove their doctrine orthodox<br/>

By apostolic blows and knocks;                                200<br/>

Call fire and sword and desolation,<br/>

A godly thorough reformation,<br/>

Which always must be carried on,<br/>

And still be doing, never done;<br/>

As if religion were intended                                  205<br/>

For nothing else but to be mended.<br/>

A sect, whose chief devotion lies<br/>

In odd perverse antipathies;<br/>

In falling out with that or this,<br/>

And finding somewhat still amiss;                             210<br/>

More peevish, cross, and splenetick,<br/>

Than dog distract, or monkey sick.<br/>

That with more care keep holy-day<br/>

The wrong, than others the right way;<br/>

Compound for sins they are inclin'd to,                       215<br/>

By damning those they have no mind to:<br/>

Still so perverse and opposite,<br/>

As if they worshipp'd God for spite.<br/>

The self-same thing they will abhor<br/>

One way, and long another for.                                220<br/>

Free-will they one way disavow,<br/>

Another, nothing else allow:<br/>

All piety consists therein<br/>

In them, in other men all sin:<br/>

Rather than fail, they will defy                              225<br/>

That which they love most tenderly;<br/>

Quarrel with minc'd-pies, and disparage<br/>

Their best and dearest friend, plum-porridge;<br/>

Fat pig and goose itself oppose,<br/>

And blaspheme custard through the nose.                       230<br/>

Th' apostles of this fierce religion,<br/>

Like MAHOMET'S, were ass and pidgeon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a><br/>

To whom our knight, by fast instinct<br/>

Of wit and temper, was so linkt,<br/>

As if hypocrisy and nonsense                                  235<br/>

Had got th' advowson of his conscience.<br/>
</p>

<p>Thus was he gifted and accouter'd;<br/>

We mean on th' inside, not the outward;<br/>

That next of all we shall discuss:<br/>

Then listen, Sirs, it follows thus                            240<br/>

His tawny beard was th' equal grace<br/>

Both of his wisdom and his face;<br/>

In cut and dye so like a tile,<br/>

A sudden view it would beguile:<br/>

The upper part thereof was whey;                              245<br/>

The nether, orange mix'd with grey.<br/>

This hairy meteor did denounce<br/>

The fall of scepters and of crowns;<br/>

With grisly type did represent<br/>

Declining age of government;                                  250<br/>

And tell with hieroglyphick spade,<br/>

Its own grave and the state's were made.<br/>

Like SAMPSON'S heart-breakers, it grew<br/>

In time to make a nation rue;<br/>

Tho' it contributed its own fall,                             255<br/>

To wait upon the publick downfal,<br/>

It was monastick, and did grow<br/>

In holy orders by strict vow;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a><br/>

Of rule as sullen and severe<br/>

As that of rigid Cordeliere.                                  260<br/>

'Twas bound to suffer persecution<br/>

And martyrdom with resolution;<br/>

T' oppose itself against the hate<br/>

And vengeance of th' incensed state;<br/>

In whose defiance it was worn,                                265<br/>

Still ready to be pull'd and torn;<br/>

With red-hot irons to be tortur'd;<br/>

Revil'd, and spit upon, and martyr'd.<br/>

Maugre all which, 'twas to stand fast<br/>

As long as monarchy shou'd last;                              270<br/>

But when the state should hap to reel,<br/>

'Twas to submit to fatal steel,<br/>

And fall, as it was consecrate,<br/>

A sacrifice to fall of state;<br/>

Whose thread of life the fatal sisters                        275<br/>

Did twist together with its whiskers,<br/>

And twine so close, that time should never,<br/>

In life or death, their fortunes sever;<br/>

But with his rusty sickle mow<br/>

Both down together at a blow.                                 280<br/>

So learned TALIACOTIUS<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a> from<br/>

The brawny part of porter's bum<br/>

Cut supplemental noses, which<br/>

Wou'd last as long as parent breech;<br/>

But when the date of NOCK was out,                            285<br/>

Off drop'd the sympathetic snout.<br/>
</p>

<p>His back, or rather burthen, show'd,<br/>

As if it stoop'd with its own load:<br/>

For as AENEAS<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a> bore his sire<br/>

Upon his shoulders thro' the fire,                            290<br/>

Our Knight did bear no less a pack<br/>

Of his own buttocks on his back;<br/>

Which now had almost got the upper-<br/>

Hand of his head, for want of crupper.<br/>

To poise this equally, he bore                                295<br/>

A paunch of the same bulk before;<br/>

Which still he had a special care<br/>

To keep well-cramm'd with thrifty fare;<br/>

As white-pot, butter-milk, and curds,<br/>

Such as a country-house affords;                              300<br/>

With other vittle, which anon<br/>

We farther shall dilate upon,<br/>

When of his hose we come to treat,<br/>

The cupboard where he kept his meat.<br/>
</p>

<p>His doublet was of sturdy buff,                               305<br/>

And tho' not sword, yet cudgel-proof;<br/>

Whereby 'twas fitter for his use,<br/>

Who fear'd no blows, but such as bruise.<br/>
</p>

<p>His breeches were of rugged woollen,<br/>

And had been at the siege of Bullen;                          310<br/>

To old King HARRY so well known,<br/>

Some writers held they were his own.<br/>

Thro' they were lin'd with many a piece<br/>

Of ammunition bread and cheese,<br/>

And fat black-puddings, proper food                           315<br/>

For warriors that delight in blood.<br/>

For, as we said, he always chose<br/>

To carry vittle in his hose,<br/>

That often tempted rats and mice<br/>

The ammunition to surprise:                                   320<br/>

And when he put a hand but in<br/>

The one or t' other magazine,<br/>

They stoutly in defence on't stood,<br/>

And from the wounded foe drew blood;<br/>

And 'till th' were storm'd and beaten out,                    325<br/>

Ne'er left the fortify'd redoubt.<br/>

And tho' Knights Errant, as some think,<br/>

Of old did neither eat nor drink,<br/>

Because, when thorough desarts vast,<br/>

And regions desolate, they past,                              330<br/>

Where belly-timber above ground,<br/>

Or under, was not to be found,<br/>

Unless they graz'd, there's not one word<br/>

Of their provision on record;<br/>

Which made some confidently write,                            335<br/>

They had no stomachs, but to fight.<br/>

'Tis false: for ARTHUR<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> wore in hall<br/>

Round table like a farthingal,<br/>

On which with shirt pull'd out behind,<br/>

And eke before, his good Knights din'd.                       340<br/>

Though 'twas no table, some suppose,<br/>

But a huge pair of round trunk hose;<br/>

In which he carry'd as much meat<br/>

As he and all the Knights cou'd eat,<br/>

When, laying by their swords and truncheons,                  345<br/>

They took their breakfasts, or their nuncheons.<br/>

But let that pass at present, lest<br/>

We should forget where we digrest,<br/>

As learned authors use, to whom<br/>

We leave it, and to th' purpose come,                         350<br/>
</p>

<p>His puissant sword unto his side,<br/>

Near his undaunted heart, was ty'd;<br/>

With basket-hilt, that wou'd hold broth,<br/>

And serve for fight and dinner both.<br/>

In it he melted lead for bullets,                             355<br/>

To shoot at foes, and sometimes pullets,<br/>

To whom he bore so fell a grutch,<br/>

He ne'er gave quarter t' any such.<br/>

The trenchant blade, Toledo trusty,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a><br/>

For want of fighting, was grown rusty,                        360<br/>

And ate unto itself, for lack<br/>

Of somebody to hew and hack.<br/>

The peaceful scabbard where it dwelt<br/>

The rancour of its edge had felt;<br/>

For of the lower end two handful                              365<br/>

It had devour'd, 'twas so manful;<br/>

And so much scorn'd to lurk in case,<br/>

As if it durst not shew its face.<br/>

In many desperate attempts,<br/>

Of warrants, exigents, contempts,                             370<br/>

It had appear'd with courage bolder<br/>

Than Serjeant BUM invading shoulder.<br/>

Oft had it ta'en possession,<br/>

And pris'ners too, or made them run.<br/>
</p>

<p>This sword a dagger had t' his page,                          375<br/>

That was but little for his age;<br/>

And therefore waited on him so,<br/>

As dwarfs upon Knights Errant do.<br/>

It was a serviceable dudgeon,<br/>

Either for fighting or for drudging.                          380<br/>

When it had stabb'd, or broke a head,<br/>

It would scrape trenchers, or chip bread;<br/>

Toast cheese or bacon; tho' it were<br/>

To bait a mouse-trap, 'twould not care.<br/>

'Twould make clean shoes; and in the earth                    385<br/>

Set leeks and onions, and so forth.<br/>

It had been 'prentice to a brewer,<br/>

Where this and more it did endure;<br/>

But left the trade, as many more<br/>

Have lately done on the same score.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a>                           390<br/>
</p>

<p>In th' holsters, at his saddle-bow,<br/>

Two aged pistols he did stow,<br/>

Among the surplus of such meat<br/>

As in his hose he cou'd not get.<br/>

These wou'd inveigle rats with th' scent,                     395<br/>

To forage when the cocks were bent;<br/>

And sometimes catch 'em with a snap<br/>

As cleverly as th' ablest trap.<br/>

They were upon hard duty still,<br/>

And ev'ry night stood centinel,                               400<br/>

To guard the magazine i' th' hose<br/>

From two-legg'd and from four-legg'd foes.<br/>
</p>

<p>Thus clad and fortify'd, Sir Knight<br/>

From peaceful home set forth to fight.<br/>

But first with nimble, active force                           405<br/>

He got on th' outside of his horse;<br/>

For having but one stirrup ty'd<br/>

T' his saddle, on the further side,<br/>

It was so short, h' had much ado<br/>

To reach it with his desp'rate toe:                           410<br/>

But, after many strains and heaves,<br/>

He got up to the saddle-eaves,<br/>

From whence he vaulted into th' seat,<br/>

With so much vigour, strength and heat,<br/>

That he had almost tumbled over                               415<br/>

With his own weight, but did recover,<br/>

By laying hold on tail and main,<br/>

Which oft he us'd instead of rein.<br/>
</p>

<p>But now we talk of mounting steed,<br/>

Before we further do proceed,                                 420<br/>

It doth behoves us to say something<br/>

Of that which bore our valiant bumkin.<br/>

The beast was sturdy, large, and tall,<br/>

With mouth of meal, and eyes of wall.<br/>

I wou'd say eye; for h' had but one,                          425<br/>

As most agree; tho' some say none.<br/>

He was well stay'd; and in his gait<br/>

Preserv'd a grave, majestick state.<br/>

At spur or switch no more he skipt,<br/>

Or mended pace, than Spaniard whipt;                          430<br/>

And yet so fiery, he wou'd bound<br/>

As if he griev'd to touch the ground:<br/>

That CAESAR's horse who, as fame goes<br/>

Had corns upon his feet and toes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a><br/>

Was not by half so tender hooft,                              435<br/>

Nor trod upon the ground so soft.<br/>

And as that beast would kneel and stoop<br/>

(Some write) to take his rider up,<br/>

So HUDIBRAS his ('tis well known)<br/>

Wou'd often do to set him down.                               440<br/>

We shall not need to say what lack<br/>

Of leather was upon his back;<br/>

For that was hidden under pad,<br/>

And breech of Knight, gall'd full as bad.<br/>

His strutting ribs on both sides show'd                       445<br/>

Like furrows he himself had plow'd;<br/>

For underneath the skirt of pannel,<br/>

'Twixt ev'ry two there was a channel<br/>

His draggling tail hung in the dirt,<br/>

Which on his rider he wou'd flurt,                            450<br/>

Still as his tender side he prick'd,<br/>

With arm'd heel, or with unarm'd kick'd:<br/>

For HUDIBRAS wore but one spur;<br/>

As wisely knowing, cou'd he stir<br/>

To active trot one side of's horse,                           455<br/>

The other wou'd not hang an arse.<br/>
</p>

<p>A squire he had, whose name was RALPH,<br/>

That in th' adventure went his half:<br/>

Though writers, for more stately tone,<br/>

Do call him RALPHO; 'tis all one;                             460<br/>

And when we can with metre safe,<br/>

We'll call him so; if not, plain RALPH:<br/>

(For rhyme the rudder is of verses,<br/>

With which like ships they steer their courses.)<br/>

An equal stock of wit and valour                              465<br/>

He had laid in; by birth a taylor.<br/>

The mighty Tyrian Queen, that gain'd<br/>

With subtle shreds a tract of land,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a><br/>

Did leave it with a castle fair<br/>

To his great ancestor, her heir.                              470<br/>

From him descended cross-legg'd Knights,<br/>

Fam'd for their faith, and warlike fights<br/>

Against the bloody cannibal,<br/>

Whom they destroy'd both great and small.<br/>

This sturdy Squire, he had, as well                           475<br/>

As the bold Trojan Knight, seen Hell;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a><br/>

Not with a counterfeited pass<br/>

Of golden bough, but true gold-lace.<br/>

His knowledge was not far behind<br/>

The Knight's, but of another kind,                            480<br/>

And he another way came by 't:<br/>

Some call it GIFTS, and some NEW-LIGHT;<br/>

A liberal art, that costs no pains<br/>

Of study, industry, or brains.<br/>

His wit was sent him for a token,                             485<br/>

But in the carriage crack'd and broken.<br/>

Like commendation nine-pence crook'd,<br/>

With — To and from my love — it look'd.<br/>

He ne'er consider'd it, as loth<br/>

To look a gift-horse in the mouth;                            490<br/>

And very wisely wou'd lay forth<br/>

No more upon it than 'twas worth.<br/>

But as he got it freely, so<br/>

He spent it frank and freely too.<br/>

For Saints themselves will sometimes be                       495<br/>

Of gifts, that cost them nothing, free.<br/>

By means of this, with hem and cough,<br/>

Prolongers to enlighten'd stuff,<br/>

He cou'd deep mysteries unriddle<br/>

As easily as thread a needle.                                 500<br/>

For as of vagabonds we say,<br/>

That they are ne'er beside their way;<br/>

Whate'er men speak by this New Light,<br/>

Still they are sure to be i' th' right.<br/>

'Tis a dark-lanthorn of the Spirit,                           505<br/>

Which none see by but those that bear it:<br/>

A light that falls down from on high,<br/>

For spiritual trades to cozen by<br/>

An Ignis Fatuus, that bewitches<br/>

And leads men into pools and ditches,                         510<br/>

To make them dip themselves, and sound<br/>

For Christendom in dirty pond<br/>

To dive like wild-fowl for salvation,<br/>

And fish to catch regeneration.<br/>

This light inspires and plays upon                            515<br/>

The nose of Saint like bag-pipe drone,<br/>

And speaks through hollow empty soul,<br/>

As through a trunk, or whisp'ring hole,<br/>

Such language as no mortal ear<br/>

But spirit'al eaves-droppers can hear:                        520<br/>

So PHOEBUS, or some friendly muse,<br/>

Into small poets song infuse,<br/>

Which they at second-hand rehearse,<br/>

Thro' reed or bag-pipe, verse for verse.<br/>
</p>

<p>Thus RALPH became infallible                                  525<br/>

As three or four-legg'd oracle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-35" id="noteref-35" epub:type="noteref">35</a><br/>

The ancient cup, or modern chair;<br/>

Spoke truth point-blank, tho' unaware.<br/>
</p>

<p>For MYSTICK LEARNING, wond'rous able<br/>

In magick Talisman and Cabal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-36" id="noteref-36" epub:type="noteref">36</a>                             530<br/>

Whose primitive tradition reaches<br/>

As far as ADAM'S first green breeches:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-37" id="noteref-37" epub:type="noteref">37</a><br/>

Deep-sighted in intelligences,<br/>

Ideas, atoms, influences;<br/>

And much of Terra Incognita,                               535<br/>

Th' intelligible world, cou'd say:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-38" id="noteref-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a><br/>

A deep OCCULT PHILOSOPHER,<br/>

As learn'd as the wild Irish are,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a><br/>

Or Sir AGRIPPA; for profound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-40" id="noteref-40" epub:type="noteref">40</a><br/>

And solid lying much renown'd.                                540<br/>

He ANTHROPOSOPHUS, and FLOUD,<br/>

And JACOB BEHMEN understood:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-41" id="noteref-41" epub:type="noteref">41</a><br/>

Knew many an amulet and charm,<br/>

That wou'd do neither good nor harm:<br/>

In ROSY-CRUCIAN lore as learned,                          545<br/>

As he that Vere adeptus earned.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-42" id="noteref-42" epub:type="noteref">42</a><br/>

He understood the speech of birds<br/>

As well as they themselves do words;<br/>

Cou'd tell what subtlest parrots mean,<br/>

That speak, and think contrary clean:                         550<br/>

What Member 'tis of whom they talk,<br/>

When they cry, Rope, and walk, knave, walk.<br/>

He'd extract numbers out of matter,<br/>

And keep them in a glass, like water;<br/>

Of sov'reign pow'r to make men wise;                          555<br/>

For drop'd in blear thick-sighted eyes,<br/>

They'd make them see in darkest night<br/>

Like owls, tho' purblind in the light.<br/>

By help of these (as he profess'd)<br/>

He had First Matter seen undress'd:                           560<br/>

He took her naked all alone,<br/>

Before one rag of form was on.<br/>

The Chaos too he had descry'd,<br/>

And seen quite thro', or else he ly'd:<br/>

Not that of paste-board which men shew                        565<br/>

For groats, at fair of Barthol'mew;<br/>

But its great grandsire, first o' the name,<br/>

Whence that and REFORMATION came;<br/>

Both cousin-germans, and right able<br/>

T' inveigle and draw in the rabble.                           570<br/>

But Reformation was, some say,<br/>

O' th' younger house to Puppet-play.<br/>

He cou'd foretel whats'ever was<br/>

By consequence to come to pass;<br/>

As death of great men, alterations,                           575<br/>

Diseases, battles, inundations.<br/>

All this, without th' eclipse o' th' sun,<br/>

Or dreadful comet, he hath done,<br/>

By inward light; away as good,<br/>

And easy to be understood;                                    580<br/>

But with more lucky hit than those<br/>

That use to make the stars depose,<br/>

Like Knights o' th' post, and falsely charge<br/>

Upon themselves what others forge:<br/>

As if they were consenting to                                 585<br/>

All mischiefs in the world men do:<br/>

Or, like the Devil, did tempt and sway 'em<br/>

To rogueries, and then betray 'em.<br/>

They'll search a planet's house, to know<br/>

Who broke and robb'd a house below:                           590<br/>

Examine VENUS, and the MOON,<br/>

Who stole a thimble or a spoon;<br/>

And tho' they nothing will confess,<br/>

Yet by their very looks can guess,<br/>

And tell what guilty aspect bodes,                            595<br/>

Who stole, and who receiv'd the goods.<br/>

They'll question MARS, and, by his look,<br/>

Detect who 'twas that nimm'd a cloke:<br/>

Make MERCURY confess, and 'peach<br/>

Those thieves which he himself did teach.                     600<br/>

They'll find, i' th' physiognomies<br/>

O' th' planets, all men's destinies.;<br/>

Like him that took the doctor's bill,<br/>

And swallow'd it instead o' th' pill<br/>

Cast the nativity o' th' question,                            605<br/>

And from positions to be guess'd on,<br/>

As sure as it' they knew the moment<br/>

Of natives birth, tell what will come on't.<br/>

They'll feel the pulses of the stars,<br/>

To find out agues, coughs, catarrhs;                          610<br/>

And tell what crisis does divine<br/>

The rot in sheep, or mange in swine<br/>

In men, what gives or cures the itch;<br/>

What makes them cuckolds, poor or rich;<br/>

What gains or loses, hangs or saves;                          615<br/>

What makes men great, what fools or knaves,<br/>

But not what wise; for only of those<br/>

The stars (they say) cannot dispose,<br/>

No more than can the Astrologians.<br/>

There they say right, and like true Trojans.<br/>

This RALPHO knew, and therefore took                          620<br/>

The other course, of which we spoke.<br/>
</p>

<p>Thus was the accomplish'd Squire endu'd<br/>

With gifts and knowledge, per'lous shrew'd.<br/>

Never did trusty Squire with Knight,<br/>

Or Knight with Squire, e'er jump more right.                  625<br/>

Their arms and equipage did fit,<br/>

As well as virtues, parts, and wit.<br/>

Their valours too were of a rate;<br/>

And out they sally'd at the gate.                             630<br/>

Few miles on horseback had they jogged,<br/>

But Fortune unto them turn'd dogged;<br/>

For they a sad adventure met,<br/>

Of which anon we mean to treat;<br/>

But ere we venture to unfold                                  635<br/>

Atchievements so resolv'd and bold,<br/>

We shou'd as learned poets use,<br/>

Invoke th' assistance of some muse:<br/>

However, criticks count it sillier<br/>

Than jugglers talking to familiar.                            640<br/>

We think 'tis no great matter which<br/>

They're all alike; yet we shall pitch<br/>

On one that fits our purpose most<br/>

Whom therefore thus do we accost:<br/>
</p>

<p>Thou that with ale, or viler liquors,                         645<br/>

Did'st inspire WITHERS, PRYN, and VICKARS,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-43" id="noteref-43" epub:type="noteref">43</a><br/>

And force them, tho' it was in spite<br/>

Of nature and their stars, to write;<br/>

Who, as we find in sullen writs,<br/>

And cross-grain'd works of modern wits,                       650<br/>

With vanity, opinion, want,<br/>

The wonder of the ignorant,<br/>

The praises of the author, penn'd<br/>

B' himself, or wit-insuring friend;<br/>

The itch of picture in the front,                             655<br/>

With bays and wicked rhyme upon't;<br/>

All that is left o' th' forked hill,<br/>

To make men scribble without skill;<br/>

Canst make a poet spite of fate,<br/>

And teach all people to translate,                            660<br/>

Tho' out of languages in which<br/>

They understand no part of speech;<br/>

Assist me but this once, I 'mplore,<br/>

And I shall trouble thee no more.<br/>
</p>

<p>In western clime there is a town,                             665<br/>

To those that dwell therein well known;<br/>

Therefore there needs no more be said here,<br/>

We unto them refer our reader;<br/>

For brevity is very good,<br/>

When w' are, or are not, understood.                          670<br/>

To this town people did repair,<br/>

On days of market, or of fair,<br/>

And, to crack'd fiddle, and hoarse tabor,<br/>

In merriment did drudge and labor.<br/>

But now a sport more formidable                               675<br/>

Had rak'd together village rabble:<br/>

'Twas an old way of recreating,<br/>

Which learned butchers call bear-baiting:<br/>

A bold advent'rous exercise,<br/>

With ancient heroes in high prize:                            680<br/>

For authors do affirm it came<br/>

From Isthmian or Nemean game:<br/>

Others derive it from the bear<br/>

That's fix'd in northern hemisphere,<br/>

And round about the pole does make                            685<br/>

A circle like a bear at stake,<br/>

That at the chain's end wheels about,<br/>

And overturns the rabble-rout.<br/>

For after solemn proclamation,<br/>

In the bear's name, (as is the fashion,                       690<br/>

According to the law of arms,<br/>

To keep men from inglorious harms,)<br/>

That none presume to come so near<br/>

As forty foot of stake of bear,<br/>

If any yet be so fool-hardy,                                  695<br/>

T' expose themselves to vain jeopardy,<br/>

If they come wounded off, and lame,<br/>

No honour's got by such a maim;<br/>

Altho' the bear gain much, b'ing bound<br/>

In honour to make good his ground,                            700<br/>

When he's engag'd, and takes no notice,<br/>

If any press upon him, who 'tis;<br/>

But let's them know, at their own cost,<br/>

That he intends to keep his post.<br/>

This to prevent, and other harms,                             705<br/>

Which always wait on feats of arms,<br/>

(For in the hurry of a fray<br/>

'Tis hard to keep out of harm's way,)<br/>

Thither the Knight his course did steer,<br/>

To keep the peace 'twixt dog and bear;                        710<br/>

As he believ'd he was bound to do<br/>

In conscience, and commission too;<br/>

And therefore thus bespoke the Squire.<br/>
</p>

<p>We that are wisely mounted higher<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-44" id="noteref-44" epub:type="noteref">44</a><br/>

Than constables in curule wit,<br/>

When on tribunal bench we sit,<br/>

Like speculators shou'd foresee,<br/>

From Pharos of authority,<br/>

Portended mischiefs farther then<br/>

Low Proletarian tything-men:                                  720<br/>

And therefore being inform'd by bruit,<br/>

That dog and bear are to dispute;<br/>

For so of late men fighting name,<br/>

Because they often prove the same;<br/>

(For where the first does hap to be,                          725<br/>

The last does coincidere;)<br/>

Quantum in nobis, have thought good,<br/>

To save th' expence of Christian blood,<br/>

And try if we, by mediation<br/>

Of treaty and accommodation,                                  730<br/>

Can end the quarrel and compose<br/>

The bloody duel without blows.<br/>

Are not our liberties, our lives,<br/>

The laws, religion and our wives,<br/>

Enough at once to lie at stake                                735<br/>

For Cov'nant and the Cause's sake?<br/>

But in that quarrel dogs and bears,<br/>

As well as we must venture theirs<br/>

This feud, by Jesuits invented,<br/>

By evil counsel is fomented:                                  740<br/>

There is a MACHIAVILIAN plot,<br/>

(Tho' ev'ry Nare olfact is not,)<br/>

A deep design in't, to divide<br/>

The well-affected that confide,<br/>

By setting brother against brother,                           745<br/>

To claw and curry one another.<br/>

Have we not enemies plus satis,<br/>

That Cane &amp; Angue pejus hate us?<br/>

And shall we turn our fangs and claws<br/>

Upon our own selves, without cause?                           750<br/>

That some occult design doth lie<br/>

In bloody cynarctomachy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-45" id="noteref-45" epub:type="noteref">45</a><br/>

Is plain enough to him that knows<br/>

How Saints lead brothers by the nose.<br/>

I wish myself a pseudo-prophet,                               755<br/>

But sure some mischief will come of it;<br/>

Unless by providential wit,<br/>

Or force, we averruncate it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-46" id="noteref-46" epub:type="noteref">46</a><br/>

For what design, what interest,<br/>

Can beast have to encounter beast?                            760<br/>

They fight for no espoused cause,<br/>

Frail privilege, fundamental laws,<br/>

Not for a thorough reformation,<br/>

Nor covenant, nor protestation,<br/>

Nor liberty of consciences,                                   765<br/>

Nor Lords and Commons ordinances;<br/>

Nor for the church, nor for church-lands,<br/>

To get them in their own no hands;<br/>

Nor evil counsellors to bring<br/>

To justice that seduce the King;                              770<br/>

Nor for the worship of us men,<br/>

Though we have done as much for them.<br/>

Th' AEgyptians worshipp'd dogs, and for<br/>

Their faith made internecine war.<br/>

Others ador'd a rat, and some                                 775<br/>

For that church suffer'd martyrdom.<br/>

The Indians fought for the truth<br/>

Of th' elephant and monkey's tooth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-47" id="noteref-47" epub:type="noteref">47</a><br/>

And many, to defend that faith,<br/>

Fought it out mordicus to death.                              780<br/>

But no beast ever was so slight,<br/>

For man, as for his God, to fight.<br/>

They have more wit, alas! and know<br/>

Themselves and us better than so.<br/>

But we, who only do infuse                                    785<br/>

The rage in them like Boute-feus;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-48" id="noteref-48" epub:type="noteref">48</a><br/>

'Tis our example that instils<br/>

In them th' infection of our ills.<br/>

For, as some late philosophers.<br/>

Have well observ'd, beasts, that converse                     790<br/>

With man, take after him, as hogs<br/>

Get pigs all the year, and bitches dogs.<br/>

Just so, by our example, cattle<br/>

Learn to give one another battle.<br/>

We read, in NERO's time, the heathen,                         795<br/>

When they destroy'd the Christian brethren,<br/>

Did sew them in the skins of bears,<br/>

And then set dogs about their ears:<br/>

From thence, no doubt, th' invention came<br/>

Of this lewd antichristian game.                              800<br/>
</p>

<p>To this, quoth RALPHO, Verily<br/>

The point seems very plain to me.<br/>

It is an antichristian game,<br/>

Unlawful both in thing and name.<br/>

First, for the name: the word, bear-baiting                   805<br/>

Is carnal, and of man's creating:<br/>

For certainly there's no such word<br/>

In all the scripture on record;<br/>

Therefore unlawful, and a sin;<br/>

And so is (secondly) the thing.                               810<br/>

A vile assembly 'tis, that can<br/>

No more be prov'd by scripture than<br/>

Provincial, classic, national;<br/>

Mere human-creature cobwebs all.<br/>

Thirdly, it is idolatrous;                                    815<br/>

For when men run a whoring thus<br/>

With their inventions, whatsoe'er<br/>

The thing be, whether dog or bear,<br/>

It is idolatrous and pagan,<br/>

No less than worshipping of DAGON.                            820<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, I smell a rat;<br/>

RALPHO, thou dost prevaricate:<br/>

For though the thesis which thou lay'st<br/>

Be true ad amussim, as thou say'st;<br/>

(For that bear-baiting should appear                          825<br/>

Jure divino lawfuller<br/>

Than synods are, thou dost deny,<br/>

Totidem verbis; so do I;)<br/>

Yet there's a fallacy in this;<br/>

For if by sly HOMAEOSIS,                                      830<br/>

Tussis pro crepitu, an art<br/>

Under a cough to slur a f—t<br/>

Thou wou'dst sophistically imply,<br/>

Both are unlawful, I deny.<br/>
</p>

<p>And I (quoth RALPHO) do not doubt                             835<br/>

But bear-baiting may be made out,<br/>

In gospel-times, as lawful as is<br/>

Provincial or parochial classis;<br/>

And that both are so near of kin,<br/>

And like in all, as well as sin,                              840<br/>

That put them in a bag, and shake 'em,<br/>

Yourself o' th' sudden would mistake 'em,<br/>

And not know which is which, unless<br/>

You measure by their wickedness:<br/>

For 'tis not hard t'imagine whether                           845<br/>

O' th' two is worst; tho' I name neither.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, Thou offer'st much,<br/>

But art not able to keep touch.<br/>

Mira de lente, as 'tis i' th' adage,<br/>

Id est, to make a leek a cabbage;                             850<br/>

Thou'lt be at best but such a bull,<br/>

Or shear-swine, all cry, and no wool;<br/>

For what can synods have at all<br/>

With bear that's analogical?<br/>

Or what relation has debating                                 855<br/>

Of church-affairs with bear-baiting?<br/>

A just comparison still is<br/>

Of things ejusdem generis;<br/>

And then what genus rightly doth<br/>

Include and comprehend them both?                             860<br/>

If animal both of us may<br/>

As justly pass for bears as they;<br/>

For we are animals no less,<br/>

Altho' of different specieses.<br/>

But, RALPHO, this is not fit place                            865<br/>

Nor time to argue out the case:<br/>

For now the field is not far off,<br/>

Where we must give the world a proof<br/>

Of deeds, not words, and such as suit<br/>

Another manner of dispute;                                    870<br/>

A controversy that affords<br/>

Actions for arguments, not words;<br/>

Which we must manage at a rate<br/>

Of prowess and conduct adequate<br/>

To what our place and fame doth promise,                      875<br/>

And all the godly expect from us,<br/>

Nor shall they be deceiv'd, unless<br/>

We're slurr'd and outed by success;<br/>

Success, the mark no mortal wit,<br/>

Or surest hand can always hit:                                880<br/>

For whatsoe'er we perpetrate,<br/>

We do but row, we're steer'd by Fate,<br/>

Which in success oft disinherits,<br/>

For spurious causes, noblest merits.<br/>

Great actions are not always true sons                        885<br/>

Of great and mighty resolutions;<br/>

Nor do th' boldest attempts bring forth<br/>

Events still equal to their worth;<br/>

But sometimes fail, and, in their stead,<br/>

Fortune and cowardice succeed.                                890<br/>

Yet we have no great cause to doubt;<br/>

Our actions still have borne us out;<br/>

Which tho' they're known to be so ample,<br/>

We need not copy from example.<br/>

We're not the only persons durst                              895<br/>

Attempt this province, nor the first.<br/>

In northern clime a val'rous Knight<br/>

Did whilom kill his bear in fght,<br/>

And wound a fiddler; we have both<br/>

Of these the objects of our wroth,                            900<br/>

And equal fame and glory from<br/>

Th' attempt of victory to come.<br/>

'Tis sung, there is a valiant Mamaluke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-49" id="noteref-49" epub:type="noteref">49</a><br/>

In foreign land, yclep'd —<br/>

To whom we have been oft compar'd                             905<br/>

For person, parts; address, and beard;<br/>

Both equally reputed stout,<br/>

And in the same cause both have fought:<br/>

He oft in such attempts as these<br/>

Came off with glory and success;                              910<br/>

Nor will we fail in th' execution,<br/>

For want of equal resolution.<br/>

Honour is like a widow, won<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-50" id="noteref-50" epub:type="noteref">50</a><br/>

With brisk attempt and putting on;<br/>

With ent'ring manfully, and urging;                           915<br/>

Not slow approaches, like a virgin.<br/>
</p>

<p>'Tis said, as yerst the Phrygian Knight,<br/>

So ours with rusty steel did smite<br/>

His Trojan horse, and just as much<br/>

He mended pace upon the touch;                                920<br/>

But from his empty stomach groan'd<br/>

Just as that hollow beast did sound,<br/>

And angry answer'd from behind,<br/>

With brandish'd tail and blast of wind.<br/>

So have I seen, with armed heel,                              925<br/>

A wight bestride a Common-weal;<br/>

While still the more he kick'd and spurr'd,<br/>

The less the sullen jade has stirr'd.<br/>
