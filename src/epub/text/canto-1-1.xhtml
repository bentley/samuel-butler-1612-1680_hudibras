<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem"><p>
<span>When civil dudgeon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> first grew high,</span><br/>

<span>And men fell out they knew not why?</span><br/>

<span>When hard words, jealousies, and fears,</span><br/>

<span>Set folks together by the ears,</span><br/>

<span>And made them fight, like mad or drunk,                         5</span><br/>

<span>For Dame Religion, as for punk;</span><br/>

<span>Whose honesty they all durst swear for,</span><br/>

<span>Though not a man of them knew wherefore:</span><br/>

<span>When Gospel-Trumpeter, surrounded</span><br/>

<span>With long-ear'd rout, to battle sounded,                       10</span><br/>

<span>And pulpit, drum ecclesiastick,</span><br/>

<span>Was beat with fist, instead of a stick;</span><br/>

<span>Then did Sir Knight abandon dwelling,</span><br/>

<span>And out he rode a colonelling.</span><br/>

<span>A wight he was, whose very sight wou'd                         15</span><br/>

<span>Entitle him Mirror of Knighthood;</span><br/>

<span>That never bent his stubborn knee</span><br/>

<span>To any thing but Chivalry;</span><br/>

<span>Nor put up blow, but that which laid</span><br/>

<span>Right worshipful on shoulder-blade;                            20</span><br/>

<span>Chief of domestic knights and errant,</span><br/>

<span>Either for cartel or for warrant;</span><br/>

<span>Great on the bench, great in the saddle,</span><br/>

<span>That could as well bind o'er, as swaddle;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span><br/>

<span>Mighty he was at both of these,                                25</span><br/>

<span>And styl'd of war, as well as peace.</span><br/>

<span>(So some rats, of amphibious nature,</span><br/>

<span>Are either for the land or water).</span><br/>

<span>But here our authors make a doubt</span><br/>

<span>Whether he were more wise, or stout:                           30</span><br/>

<span>Some hold the one, and some the other;</span><br/>

<span>But howsoe'er they make a pother,</span><br/>

<span>The diff'rence was so small, his brain</span><br/>

<span>Outweigh'd his rage but half a grain;</span><br/>

<span>Which made some take him for a tool                            35</span><br/>

<span>That knaves do work with, call'd a fool,</span><br/>

<span>And offer to lay wagers that</span><br/>

<span>As MONTAIGNE, playing with his cat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span><br/>

<span>Complains she thought him but an ass,</span><br/>

<span>Much more she wou'd Sir HUDIBRAS;                              40</span><br/>

<span>(For that's the name our valiant knight</span><br/>

<span>To all his challenges did write).</span><br/>

<span>But they're mistaken very much,</span><br/>

<span>'Tis plain enough he was no such;</span><br/>

<span>We grant, although he had much wit,                            45</span><br/>

<span>H' was very shy of using it;</span><br/>

<span>As being loth to wear it out,</span><br/>

<span>And therefore bore it not about,</span><br/>

<span>Unless on holy-days, or so,</span><br/>

<span>As men their best apparel do.                                  50</span><br/>

<span>Beside, 'tis known he could speak GREEK</span><br/>

<span>As naturally as pigs squeek;</span><br/>

<span>That LATIN was no more difficile,</span><br/>

<span>Than to a blackbird 'tis to whistle:</span><br/>

<span>Being rich in both, he never scanted                           55</span><br/>

<span>His bounty unto such as wanted;</span><br/>

<span>But much of either would afford</span><br/>

<span>To many, that had not one word.</span><br/>

<span>For Hebrew roots, although they're found</span><br/>

<span>To flourish most in barren ground,                             60</span><br/>

<span>He had such plenty, as suffic'd</span><br/>

<span>To make some think him circumcis'd;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span><br/>

<span>And truly so,  he was, perhaps,</span><br/>

<span>Not as a proselyte, but for claps.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>He was in LOGIC a great critic,                                65</span><br/>

<span>Profoundly skill'd in analytic;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span><br/>

<span>He could distinguish, and divide</span><br/>

<span>A hair 'twixt south, and south-west side:</span><br/>

<span>On either which he would dispute,</span><br/>

<span>Confute, change hands, and still confute,                      70</span><br/>

<span>He'd undertake to prove, by force</span><br/>

<span>Of argument, a man's no horse;</span><br/>

<span>He'd prove a buzzard is no fowl,</span><br/>

<span>And that a lord may be an owl,</span><br/>

<span>A calf an alderman, a goose a justice,                         75</span><br/>

<span>And rooks Committee-men and Trustees.</span><br/>

<span>He'd run in debt by disputation,</span><br/>

<span>And pay with ratiocination.</span><br/>

<span>All this by syllogism, true</span><br/>

<span>In mood and figure, he would do.                               80</span><br/>

<span>For RHETORIC, he could not ope</span><br/>

<span>His mouth, but out there flew a trope;</span><br/>

<span>And when he happen'd to break off</span><br/>

<span>I' th' middle of his speech, or cough,</span><br/>

<span>H' had hard words,ready to show why,                           85</span><br/>

<span>And tell what rules he did it by;</span><br/>

<span>Else, when with greatest art he spoke,</span><br/>

<span>You'd think he talk'd like other folk,</span><br/>

<span>For all a rhetorician's rules</span><br/>

<span>Teach nothing but to name his tools.                           90</span><br/>

<span>His ordinary rate of speech</span><br/>

<span>In loftiness of sound was rich;</span><br/>

<span>A Babylonish dialect,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span><br/>

<span>Which learned pedants much affect.</span><br/>

<span>It was a parti-colour'd dress                                  95</span><br/>

<span>Of patch'd and pie-bald languages;</span><br/>

<span>'Twas English cut on Greek and Latin,</span><br/>

<span>Like fustian heretofore on satin;</span><br/>

<span>It had an odd promiscuous tone,</span><br/>

<span>As if h' had talk'd three parts in one;                       100</span><br/>

<span>Which made some think, when he did gabble,</span><br/>

<span>Th' had heard three labourers of Babel;</span><br/>

<span>Or CERBERUS himself pronounce<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span><br/>

<span>A leash of languages at once.</span><br/>

<span>This he as volubly would vent                                 105</span><br/>

<span>As if his stock would ne'er be spent:</span><br/>

<span>And truly, to support that charge,</span><br/>

<span>He had supplies as vast and large;</span><br/>

<span>For he cou'd coin, or counterfeit</span><br/>

<span>New words, with little or no wit:                             110</span><br/>

<span>Words so debas'd and hard, no stone</span><br/>

<span>Was hard enough to touch them on;</span><br/>

<span>And when with hasty noise he spoke 'em,</span><br/>

<span>The ignorant for current took 'em;</span><br/>

<span>That had the orator, who once<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a>                             115</span><br/>

<span>Did fill his mouth with pebble stones</span><br/>

<span>When he harangu'd, but known his phrase</span><br/>

<span>He would have us'd no other ways.</span><br/>

<span>In MATHEMATICKS he was greater</span><br/>

<span>Than TYCHO BRAHE,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> or ERRA PATER:                          120</span><br/>

<span>For he, by geometric scale,</span><br/>

<span>Could take the size of pots of ale;</span><br/>

<span>Resolve, by sines and tangents straight,</span><br/>

<span>If bread or butter wanted weight,</span><br/>

<span>And wisely tell what hour o' th' day                          125</span><br/>

<span>The clock does strike by algebra.</span><br/>

<span>Beside, he was a shrewd PHILOSOPHER,</span><br/>

<span>And had read ev'ry text and gloss over;</span><br/>

<span>Whate'er the crabbed'st author hath,</span><br/>

<span>He understood b' implicit faith:                              130</span><br/>

<span>Whatever sceptic could inquire for,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span><br/>

<span>For ev'ry why he had a wherefore;</span><br/>

<span>Knew more than forty of them do,</span><br/>

<span>As far as words and terms cou'd go.</span><br/>

<span>All which he understood by rote,                              135</span><br/>

<span>And, as occasion serv'd, would quote;</span><br/>

<span>No matter whether right or wrong,</span><br/>

<span>They might be either said or sung.</span><br/>

<span>His notions fitted things so well,</span><br/>

<span>That which was which he could not tell;                       140</span><br/>

<span>But oftentimes mistook th' one</span><br/>

<span>For th' other, as great clerks have done.</span><br/>

<span>He could reduce all things to acts,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span><br/>

<span>And knew their natures by abstracts;</span><br/>

<span>Where entity and quiddity,                                    145</span><br/>

<span>The ghosts of defunct bodies fly;</span><br/>

<span>Where truth in person does appear,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span><br/>

<span>Like words congeal'd in northern air.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span><br/>

<span>He knew what's what, and that's as high</span><br/>

<span>As metaphysic wit can fly;                                    150</span><br/>

<span>In school-divinity as able</span><br/>

<span>As he that hight, Irrefragable;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a></span><br/>

<span>A second THOMAS, or, at once,</span><br/>

<span>To name them all, another DUNCE:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a></span><br/>

<span>Profound in all the Nominal                                   155</span><br/>

<span>And Real ways, beyond them all:</span><br/>

<span>For he a rope of sand cou'd twist</span><br/>

<span>As tough as learned SORBONIST;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span><br/>

<span>And weave fine cobwebs, fit for skull</span><br/>

<span>That's empty when the moon is full;                           160</span><br/>

<span>Such as take lodgings in a head</span><br/>

<span>That's to be let unfurnished.</span><br/>

<span>He could raise scruples dark and nice,</span><br/>

<span>And after solve 'em in a trice;</span><br/>

<span>As if Divinity had catch'd                                    165</span><br/>

<span>The itch, on purpose to be scratch'd;</span><br/>

<span>Or, like a mountebank, did wound</span><br/>

<span>And stab herself with doubts profound,</span><br/>

<span>Only to show with how small pain</span><br/>

<span>The sores of Faith are cur'd again;                           170</span><br/>

<span>Although by woeful proof we find,</span><br/>

<span>They always leave a scar behind.</span><br/>

<span>He knew the seat of Paradise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span><br/>

<span>Could tell in what degree it lies;</span><br/>

<span>And, as he was dispos'd, could prove it,                      175</span><br/>

<span>Below the moon, or else above it.</span><br/>

<span>What Adam dreamt of, when his bride</span><br/>

<span>Came from her closet in his side:</span><br/>

<span>Whether the devil tempted her</span><br/>

<span>By a High Dutch interpreter;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a>                              180</span><br/>

<span>If either of them had a navel:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span><br/>

<span>Who first made music malleable:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span><br/>

<span>Whether the serpent, at the fall,</span><br/>

<span>Had cloven feet, or none at all.</span><br/>

<span>All this, without a gloss, or comment,                        185</span><br/>

<span>He could unriddle in a moment,</span><br/>

<span>In proper terms, such as men smatter</span><br/>

<span>When they throw out, and miss the matter.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>For his Religion, it was fit</span><br/>

<span>To match his learning and his wit;                            190</span><br/>

<span>'Twas Presbyterian true blue;</span><br/>

<span>For he was of that stubborn crew</span><br/>

<span>Of errant saints, whom all men grant</span><br/>

<span>To be the true Church Militant;</span><br/>

<span>Such as do build their faith upon                             195</span><br/>

<span>The holy text of pike and gun;</span><br/>

<span>Decide all controversies by</span><br/>

<span>Infallible artillery;</span><br/>

<span>And prove their doctrine orthodox</span><br/>

<span>By apostolic blows and knocks;                                200</span><br/>

<span>Call fire and sword and desolation,</span><br/>

<span>A godly thorough reformation,</span><br/>

<span>Which always must be carried on,</span><br/>

<span>And still be doing, never done;</span><br/>

<span>As if religion were intended                                  205</span><br/>

<span>For nothing else but to be mended.</span><br/>

<span>A sect, whose chief devotion lies</span><br/>

<span>In odd perverse antipathies;</span><br/>

<span>In falling out with that or this,</span><br/>

<span>And finding somewhat still amiss;                             210</span><br/>

<span>More peevish, cross, and splenetick,</span><br/>

<span>Than dog distract, or monkey sick.</span><br/>

<span>That with more care keep holy-day</span><br/>

<span>The wrong, than others the right way;</span><br/>

<span>Compound for sins they are inclin'd to,                       215</span><br/>

<span>By damning those they have no mind to:</span><br/>

<span>Still so perverse and opposite,</span><br/>

<span>As if they worshipp'd God for spite.</span><br/>

<span>The self-same thing they will abhor</span><br/>

<span>One way, and long another for.                                220</span><br/>

<span>Free-will they one way disavow,</span><br/>

<span>Another, nothing else allow:</span><br/>

<span>All piety consists therein</span><br/>

<span>In them, in other men all sin:</span><br/>

<span>Rather than fail, they will defy                              225</span><br/>

<span>That which they love most tenderly;</span><br/>

<span>Quarrel with minc'd-pies, and disparage</span><br/>

<span>Their best and dearest friend, plum-porridge;</span><br/>

<span>Fat pig and goose itself oppose,</span><br/>

<span>And blaspheme custard through the nose.                       230</span><br/>

<span>Th' apostles of this fierce religion,</span><br/>

<span>Like MAHOMET'S, were ass and pidgeon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span><br/>

<span>To whom our knight, by fast instinct</span><br/>

<span>Of wit and temper, was so linkt,</span><br/>

<span>As if hypocrisy and nonsense                                  235</span><br/>

<span>Had got th' advowson of his conscience.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Thus was he gifted and accouter'd;</span><br/>

<span>We mean on th' inside, not the outward;</span><br/>

<span>That next of all we shall discuss:</span><br/>

<span>Then listen, Sirs, it follows thus                            240</span><br/>

<span>His tawny beard was th' equal grace</span><br/>

<span>Both of his wisdom and his face;</span><br/>

<span>In cut and dye so like a tile,</span><br/>

<span>A sudden view it would beguile:</span><br/>

<span>The upper part thereof was whey;                              245</span><br/>

<span>The nether, orange mix'd with grey.</span><br/>

<span>This hairy meteor did denounce</span><br/>

<span>The fall of scepters and of crowns;</span><br/>

<span>With grisly type did represent</span><br/>

<span>Declining age of government;                                  250</span><br/>

<span>And tell with hieroglyphick spade,</span><br/>

<span>Its own grave and the state's were made.</span><br/>

<span>Like SAMPSON'S heart-breakers, it grew</span><br/>

<span>In time to make a nation rue;</span><br/>

<span>Tho' it contributed its own fall,                             255</span><br/>

<span>To wait upon the publick downfal,</span><br/>

<span>It was monastick, and did grow</span><br/>

<span>In holy orders by strict vow;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span><br/>

<span>Of rule as sullen and severe</span><br/>

<span>As that of rigid Cordeliere.                                  260</span><br/>

<span>'Twas bound to suffer persecution</span><br/>

<span>And martyrdom with resolution;</span><br/>

<span>T' oppose itself against the hate</span><br/>

<span>And vengeance of th' incensed state;</span><br/>

<span>In whose defiance it was worn,                                265</span><br/>

<span>Still ready to be pull'd and torn;</span><br/>

<span>With red-hot irons to be tortur'd;</span><br/>

<span>Revil'd, and spit upon, and martyr'd.</span><br/>

<span>Maugre all which, 'twas to stand fast</span><br/>

<span>As long as monarchy shou'd last;                              270</span><br/>

<span>But when the state should hap to reel,</span><br/>

<span>'Twas to submit to fatal steel,</span><br/>

<span>And fall, as it was consecrate,</span><br/>

<span>A sacrifice to fall of state;</span><br/>

<span>Whose thread of life the fatal sisters                        275</span><br/>

<span>Did twist together with its whiskers,</span><br/>

<span>And twine so close, that time should never,</span><br/>

<span>In life or death, their fortunes sever;</span><br/>

<span>But with his rusty sickle mow</span><br/>

<span>Both down together at a blow.                                 280</span><br/>

<span>So learned TALIACOTIUS<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a> from</span><br/>

<span>The brawny part of porter's bum</span><br/>

<span>Cut supplemental noses, which</span><br/>

<span>Wou'd last as long as parent breech;</span><br/>

<span>But when the date of NOCK was out,                            285</span><br/>

<span>Off drop'd the sympathetic snout.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>His back, or rather burthen, show'd,</span><br/>

<span>As if it stoop'd with its own load:</span><br/>

<span>For as AENEAS<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a> bore his sire</span><br/>

<span>Upon his shoulders thro' the fire,                            290</span><br/>

<span>Our Knight did bear no less a pack</span><br/>

<span>Of his own buttocks on his back;</span><br/>

<span>Which now had almost got the upper-</span><br/>

<span>Hand of his head, for want of crupper.</span><br/>

<span>To poise this equally, he bore                                295</span><br/>

<span>A paunch of the same bulk before;</span><br/>

<span>Which still he had a special care</span><br/>

<span>To keep well-cramm'd with thrifty fare;</span><br/>

<span>As white-pot, butter-milk, and curds,</span><br/>

<span>Such as a country-house affords;                              300</span><br/>

<span>With other vittle, which anon</span><br/>

<span>We farther shall dilate upon,</span><br/>

<span>When of his hose we come to treat,</span><br/>

<span>The cupboard where he kept his meat.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>His doublet was of sturdy buff,                               305</span><br/>

<span>And tho' not sword, yet cudgel-proof;</span><br/>

<span>Whereby 'twas fitter for his use,</span><br/>

<span>Who fear'd no blows, but such as bruise.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>His breeches were of rugged woollen,</span><br/>

<span>And had been at the siege of Bullen;                          310</span><br/>

<span>To old King HARRY so well known,</span><br/>

<span>Some writers held they were his own.</span><br/>

<span>Thro' they were lin'd with many a piece</span><br/>

<span>Of ammunition bread and cheese,</span><br/>

<span>And fat black-puddings, proper food                           315</span><br/>

<span>For warriors that delight in blood.</span><br/>

<span>For, as we said, he always chose</span><br/>

<span>To carry vittle in his hose,</span><br/>

<span>That often tempted rats and mice</span><br/>

<span>The ammunition to surprise:                                   320</span><br/>

<span>And when he put a hand but in</span><br/>

<span>The one or t' other magazine,</span><br/>

<span>They stoutly in defence on't stood,</span><br/>

<span>And from the wounded foe drew blood;</span><br/>

<span>And 'till th' were storm'd and beaten out,                    325</span><br/>

<span>Ne'er left the fortify'd redoubt.</span><br/>

<span>And tho' Knights Errant, as some think,</span><br/>

<span>Of old did neither eat nor drink,</span><br/>

<span>Because, when thorough desarts vast,</span><br/>

<span>And regions desolate, they past,                              330</span><br/>

<span>Where belly-timber above ground,</span><br/>

<span>Or under, was not to be found,</span><br/>

<span>Unless they graz'd, there's not one word</span><br/>

<span>Of their provision on record;</span><br/>

<span>Which made some confidently write,                            335</span><br/>

<span>They had no stomachs, but to fight.</span><br/>

<span>'Tis false: for ARTHUR<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> wore in hall</span><br/>

<span>Round table like a farthingal,</span><br/>

<span>On which with shirt pull'd out behind,</span><br/>

<span>And eke before, his good Knights din'd.                       340</span><br/>

<span>Though 'twas no table, some suppose,</span><br/>

<span>But a huge pair of round trunk hose;</span><br/>

<span>In which he carry'd as much meat</span><br/>

<span>As he and all the Knights cou'd eat,</span><br/>

<span>When, laying by their swords and truncheons,                  345</span><br/>

<span>They took their breakfasts, or their nuncheons.</span><br/>

<span>But let that pass at present, lest</span><br/>

<span>We should forget where we digrest,</span><br/>

<span>As learned authors use, to whom</span><br/>

<span>We leave it, and to th' purpose come,                         350</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>His puissant sword unto his side,</span><br/>

<span>Near his undaunted heart, was ty'd;</span><br/>

<span>With basket-hilt, that wou'd hold broth,</span><br/>

<span>And serve for fight and dinner both.</span><br/>

<span>In it he melted lead for bullets,                             355</span><br/>

<span>To shoot at foes, and sometimes pullets,</span><br/>

<span>To whom he bore so fell a grutch,</span><br/>

<span>He ne'er gave quarter t' any such.</span><br/>

<span>The trenchant blade, Toledo trusty,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span><br/>

<span>For want of fighting, was grown rusty,                        360</span><br/>

<span>And ate unto itself, for lack</span><br/>

<span>Of somebody to hew and hack.</span><br/>

<span>The peaceful scabbard where it dwelt</span><br/>

<span>The rancour of its edge had felt;</span><br/>

<span>For of the lower end two handful                              365</span><br/>

<span>It had devour'd, 'twas so manful;</span><br/>

<span>And so much scorn'd to lurk in case,</span><br/>

<span>As if it durst not shew its face.</span><br/>

<span>In many desperate attempts,</span><br/>

<span>Of warrants, exigents, contempts,                             370</span><br/>

<span>It had appear'd with courage bolder</span><br/>

<span>Than Serjeant BUM invading shoulder.</span><br/>

<span>Oft had it ta'en possession,</span><br/>

<span>And pris'ners too, or made them run.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>This sword a dagger had t' his page,                          375</span><br/>

<span>That was but little for his age;</span><br/>

<span>And therefore waited on him so,</span><br/>

<span>As dwarfs upon Knights Errant do.</span><br/>

<span>It was a serviceable dudgeon,</span><br/>

<span>Either for fighting or for drudging.                          380</span><br/>

<span>When it had stabb'd, or broke a head,</span><br/>

<span>It would scrape trenchers, or chip bread;</span><br/>

<span>Toast cheese or bacon; tho' it were</span><br/>

<span>To bait a mouse-trap, 'twould not care.</span><br/>

<span>'Twould make clean shoes; and in the earth                    385</span><br/>

<span>Set leeks and onions, and so forth.</span><br/>

<span>It had been 'prentice to a brewer,</span><br/>

<span>Where this and more it did endure;</span><br/>

<span>But left the trade, as many more</span><br/>

<span>Have lately done on the same score.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a>                           390</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>In th' holsters, at his saddle-bow,</span><br/>

<span>Two aged pistols he did stow,</span><br/>

<span>Among the surplus of such meat</span><br/>

<span>As in his hose he cou'd not get.</span><br/>

<span>These wou'd inveigle rats with th' scent,                     395</span><br/>

<span>To forage when the cocks were bent;</span><br/>

<span>And sometimes catch 'em with a snap</span><br/>

<span>As cleverly as th' ablest trap.</span><br/>

<span>They were upon hard duty still,</span><br/>

<span>And ev'ry night stood centinel,                               400</span><br/>

<span>To guard the magazine i' th' hose</span><br/>

<span>From two-legg'd and from four-legg'd foes.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Thus clad and fortify'd, Sir Knight</span><br/>

<span>From peaceful home set forth to fight.</span><br/>

<span>But first with nimble, active force                           405</span><br/>

<span>He got on th' outside of his horse;</span><br/>

<span>For having but one stirrup ty'd</span><br/>

<span>T' his saddle, on the further side,</span><br/>

<span>It was so short, h' had much ado</span><br/>

<span>To reach it with his desp'rate toe:                           410</span><br/>

<span>But, after many strains and heaves,</span><br/>

<span>He got up to the saddle-eaves,</span><br/>

<span>From whence he vaulted into th' seat,</span><br/>

<span>With so much vigour, strength and heat,</span><br/>

<span>That he had almost tumbled over                               415</span><br/>

<span>With his own weight, but did recover,</span><br/>

<span>By laying hold on tail and main,</span><br/>

<span>Which oft he us'd instead of rein.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>But now we talk of mounting steed,</span><br/>

<span>Before we further do proceed,                                 420</span><br/>

<span>It doth behoves us to say something</span><br/>

<span>Of that which bore our valiant bumkin.</span><br/>

<span>The beast was sturdy, large, and tall,</span><br/>

<span>With mouth of meal, and eyes of wall.</span><br/>

<span>I wou'd say eye; for h' had but one,                          425</span><br/>

<span>As most agree; tho' some say none.</span><br/>

<span>He was well stay'd; and in his gait</span><br/>

<span>Preserv'd a grave, majestick state.</span><br/>

<span>At spur or switch no more he skipt,</span><br/>

<span>Or mended pace, than Spaniard whipt;                          430</span><br/>

<span>And yet so fiery, he wou'd bound</span><br/>

<span>As if he griev'd to touch the ground:</span><br/>

<span>That CAESAR's horse who, as fame goes</span><br/>

<span>Had corns upon his feet and toes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span><br/>

<span>Was not by half so tender hooft,                              435</span><br/>

<span>Nor trod upon the ground so soft.</span><br/>

<span>And as that beast would kneel and stoop</span><br/>

<span>(Some write) to take his rider up,</span><br/>

<span>So HUDIBRAS his ('tis well known)</span><br/>

<span>Wou'd often do to set him down.                               440</span><br/>

<span>We shall not need to say what lack</span><br/>

<span>Of leather was upon his back;</span><br/>

<span>For that was hidden under pad,</span><br/>

<span>And breech of Knight, gall'd full as bad.</span><br/>

<span>His strutting ribs on both sides show'd                       445</span><br/>

<span>Like furrows he himself had plow'd;</span><br/>

<span>For underneath the skirt of pannel,</span><br/>

<span>'Twixt ev'ry two there was a channel</span><br/>

<span>His draggling tail hung in the dirt,</span><br/>

<span>Which on his rider he wou'd flurt,                            450</span><br/>

<span>Still as his tender side he prick'd,</span><br/>

<span>With arm'd heel, or with unarm'd kick'd:</span><br/>

<span>For HUDIBRAS wore but one spur;</span><br/>

<span>As wisely knowing, cou'd he stir</span><br/>

<span>To active trot one side of's horse,                           455</span><br/>

<span>The other wou'd not hang an arse.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>A squire he had, whose name was RALPH,</span><br/>

<span>That in th' adventure went his half:</span><br/>

<span>Though writers, for more stately tone,</span><br/>

<span>Do call him RALPHO; 'tis all one;                             460</span><br/>

<span>And when we can with metre safe,</span><br/>

<span>We'll call him so; if not, plain RALPH:</span><br/>

<span>(For rhyme the rudder is of verses,</span><br/>

<span>With which like ships they steer their courses.)</span><br/>

<span>An equal stock of wit and valour                              465</span><br/>

<span>He had laid in; by birth a taylor.</span><br/>

<span>The mighty Tyrian Queen, that gain'd</span><br/>

<span>With subtle shreds a tract of land,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span><br/>

<span>Did leave it with a castle fair</span><br/>

<span>To his great ancestor, her heir.                              470</span><br/>

<span>From him descended cross-legg'd Knights,</span><br/>

<span>Fam'd for their faith, and warlike fights</span><br/>

<span>Against the bloody cannibal,</span><br/>

<span>Whom they destroy'd both great and small.</span><br/>

<span>This sturdy Squire, he had, as well                           475</span><br/>

<span>As the bold Trojan Knight, seen Hell;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span><br/>

<span>Not with a counterfeited pass</span><br/>

<span>Of golden bough, but true gold-lace.</span><br/>

<span>His knowledge was not far behind</span><br/>

<span>The Knight's, but of another kind,                            480</span><br/>

<span>And he another way came by 't:</span><br/>

<span>Some call it GIFTS, and some NEW-LIGHT;</span><br/>

<span>A liberal art, that costs no pains</span><br/>

<span>Of study, industry, or brains.</span><br/>

<span>His wit was sent him for a token,                             485</span><br/>

<span>But in the carriage crack'd and broken.</span><br/>

<span>Like commendation nine-pence crook'd,</span><br/>

<span>With — To and from my love — it look'd.</span><br/>

<span>He ne'er consider'd it, as loth</span><br/>

<span>To look a gift-horse in the mouth;                            490</span><br/>

<span>And very wisely wou'd lay forth</span><br/>

<span>No more upon it than 'twas worth.</span><br/>

<span>But as he got it freely, so</span><br/>

<span>He spent it frank and freely too.</span><br/>

<span>For Saints themselves will sometimes be                       495</span><br/>

<span>Of gifts, that cost them nothing, free.</span><br/>

<span>By means of this, with hem and cough,</span><br/>

<span>Prolongers to enlighten'd stuff,</span><br/>

<span>He cou'd deep mysteries unriddle</span><br/>

<span>As easily as thread a needle.                                 500</span><br/>

<span>For as of vagabonds we say,</span><br/>

<span>That they are ne'er beside their way;</span><br/>

<span>Whate'er men speak by this New Light,</span><br/>

<span>Still they are sure to be i' th' right.</span><br/>

<span>'Tis a dark-lanthorn of the Spirit,                           505</span><br/>

<span>Which none see by but those that bear it:</span><br/>

<span>A light that falls down from on high,</span><br/>

<span>For spiritual trades to cozen by</span><br/>

<span>An Ignis Fatuus, that bewitches</span><br/>

<span>And leads men into pools and ditches,                         510</span><br/>

<span>To make them dip themselves, and sound</span><br/>

<span>For Christendom in dirty pond</span><br/>

<span>To dive like wild-fowl for salvation,</span><br/>

<span>And fish to catch regeneration.</span><br/>

<span>This light inspires and plays upon                            515</span><br/>

<span>The nose of Saint like bag-pipe drone,</span><br/>

<span>And speaks through hollow empty soul,</span><br/>

<span>As through a trunk, or whisp'ring hole,</span><br/>

<span>Such language as no mortal ear</span><br/>

<span>But spirit'al eaves-droppers can hear:                        520</span><br/>

<span>So PHOEBUS, or some friendly muse,</span><br/>

<span>Into small poets song infuse,</span><br/>

<span>Which they at second-hand rehearse,</span><br/>

<span>Thro' reed or bag-pipe, verse for verse.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Thus RALPH became infallible                                  525</span><br/>

<span>Who broke and robb'd a house below:                           590</span><br/>

<span>Examine VENUS, and the MOON,</span><br/>

<span>Who stole a thimble or a spoon;</span><br/>

<span>And tho' they nothing will confess,</span><br/>

<span>Yet by their very looks can guess,</span><br/>

<span>And tell what guilty aspect bodes,                            595</span><br/>

<span>Who stole, and who receiv'd the goods.</span><br/>

<span>They'll question MARS, and, by his look,</span><br/>

<span>Detect who 'twas that nimm'd a cloke:</span><br/>

<span>Make MERCURY confess, and 'peach</span><br/>

<span>Those thieves which he himself did teach.                     600</span><br/>

<span>They'll find, i' th' physiognomies</span><br/>

<span>O' th' planets, all men's destinies.;</span><br/>

<span>Like him that took the doctor's bill,</span><br/>

<span>And swallow'd it instead o' th' pill</span><br/>

<span>Cast the nativity o' th' question,                            605</span><br/>

<span>And from positions to be guess'd on,</span><br/>

<span>As sure as it' they knew the moment</span><br/>

<span>Of natives birth, tell what will come on't.</span><br/>

<span>They'll feel the pulses of the stars,</span><br/>

<span>To find out agues, coughs, catarrhs;                          610</span><br/>

<span>And tell what crisis does divine</span><br/>

<span>The rot in sheep, or mange in swine</span><br/>

<span>In men, what gives or cures the itch;</span><br/>

<span>What makes them cuckolds, poor or rich;</span><br/>

<span>What gains or loses, hangs or saves;                          615</span><br/>

<span>What makes men great, what fools or knaves,</span><br/>

<span>But not what wise; for only of those</span><br/>

<span>The stars (they say) cannot dispose,</span><br/>

<span>No more than can the Astrologians.</span><br/>

<span>There they say right, and like true Trojans.</span><br/>

<span>This RALPHO knew, and therefore took                          620</span><br/>

<span>The other course, of which we spoke.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Thus was the accomplish'd Squire endu'd</span><br/>

<span>With gifts and knowledge, per'lous shrew'd.</span><br/>

<span>Never did trusty Squire with Knight,</span><br/>

<span>Or Knight with Squire, e'er jump more right.                  625</span><br/>

<span>Their arms and equipage did fit,</span><br/>

<span>As well as virtues, parts, and wit.</span><br/>

<span>Their valours too were of a rate;</span><br/>

<span>And out they sally'd at the gate.                             630</span><br/>

<span>Few miles on horseback had they jogged,</span><br/>

<span>But Fortune unto them turn'd dogged;</span><br/>

<span>For they a sad adventure met,</span><br/>

<span>Of which anon we mean to treat;</span><br/>

<span>But ere we venture to unfold                                  635</span><br/>

<span>Atchievements so resolv'd and bold,</span><br/>

<span>We shou'd as learned poets use,</span><br/>

<span>Invoke th' assistance of some muse:</span><br/>

<span>However, criticks count it sillier</span><br/>

<span>Than jugglers talking to familiar.                            640</span><br/>

<span>We think 'tis no great matter which</span><br/>

<span>They're all alike; yet we shall pitch</span><br/>

<span>On one that fits our purpose most</span><br/>

<span>Whom therefore thus do we accost:</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Thou that with ale, or viler liquors,                         645</span><br/>

<span>Did'st inspire WITHERS, PRYN, and VICKARS,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-43" id="noteref-43" epub:type="noteref">43</a></span><br/>

<span>And force them, tho' it was in spite</span><br/>

<span>Of nature and their stars, to write;</span><br/>

<span>Who, as we find in sullen writs,</span><br/>

<span>And cross-grain'd works of modern wits,                       650</span><br/>

<span>With vanity, opinion, want,</span><br/>

<span>The wonder of the ignorant,</span><br/>

<span>The praises of the author, penn'd</span><br/>

<span>B' himself, or wit-insuring friend;</span><br/>

<span>The itch of picture in the front,                             655</span><br/>

<span>With bays and wicked rhyme upon't;</span><br/>

<span>All that is left o' th' forked hill,</span><br/>

<span>To make men scribble without skill;</span><br/>

<span>Canst make a poet spite of fate,</span><br/>

<span>And teach all people to translate,                            660</span><br/>

<span>Tho' out of languages in which</span><br/>

<span>They understand no part of speech;</span><br/>

<span>Assist me but this once, I 'mplore,</span><br/>

<span>And I shall trouble thee no more.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>In western clime there is a town,                             665</span><br/>

<span>To those that dwell therein well known;</span><br/>

<span>Therefore there needs no more be said here,</span><br/>

<span>We unto them refer our reader;</span><br/>

<span>For brevity is very good,</span><br/>

<span>When w' are, or are not, understood.                          670</span><br/>

<span>To this town people did repair,</span><br/>

<span>On days of market, or of fair,</span><br/>

<span>And, to crack'd fiddle, and hoarse tabor,</span><br/>

<span>In merriment did drudge and labor.</span><br/>

<span>But now a sport more formidable                               675</span><br/>

<span>Had rak'd together village rabble:</span><br/>

<span>'Twas an old way of recreating,</span><br/>

<span>Which learned butchers call bear-baiting:</span><br/>

<span>A bold advent'rous exercise,</span><br/>

<span>With ancient heroes in high prize:                            680</span><br/>

<span>For authors do affirm it came</span><br/>

<span>From Isthmian or Nemean game:</span><br/>

<span>Others derive it from the bear</span><br/>

<span>That's fix'd in northern hemisphere,</span><br/>

<span>And round about the pole does make                            685</span><br/>

<span>A circle like a bear at stake,</span><br/>

<span>That at the chain's end wheels about,</span><br/>

<span>And overturns the rabble-rout.</span><br/>

<span>For after solemn proclamation,</span><br/>

<span>In the bear's name, (as is the fashion,                       690</span><br/>

<span>According to the law of arms,</span><br/>

<span>To keep men from inglorious harms,)</span><br/>

<span>That none presume to come so near</span><br/>

<span>As forty foot of stake of bear,</span><br/>

<span>If any yet be so fool-hardy,                                  695</span><br/>

<span>T' expose themselves to vain jeopardy,</span><br/>

<span>If they come wounded off, and lame,</span><br/>

<span>No honour's got by such a maim;</span><br/>

<span>Altho' the bear gain much, b'ing bound</span><br/>

<span>In honour to make good his ground,                            700</span><br/>

<span>When he's engag'd, and takes no notice,</span><br/>

<span>If any press upon him, who 'tis;</span><br/>

<span>But let's them know, at their own cost,</span><br/>

<span>That he intends to keep his post.</span><br/>

<span>This to prevent, and other harms,                             705</span><br/>

<span>Which always wait on feats of arms,</span><br/>

<span>(For in the hurry of a fray</span><br/>

<span>'Tis hard to keep out of harm's way,)</span><br/>

<span>Thither the Knight his course did steer,</span><br/>

<span>To keep the peace 'twixt dog and bear;                        710</span><br/>

<span>As he believ'd he was bound to do</span><br/>

<span>In conscience, and commission too;</span><br/>

<span>And therefore thus bespoke the Squire.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>We that are wisely mounted higher<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-44" id="noteref-44" epub:type="noteref">44</a></span><br/>

<span>Than constables in curule wit,</span><br/>

<span>When on tribunal bench we sit,</span><br/>

<span>Like speculators shou'd foresee,</span><br/>

<span>From Pharos of authority,</span><br/>

<span>Portended mischiefs farther then</span><br/>

<span>Low Proletarian tything-men:                                  720</span><br/>

<span>And therefore being inform'd by bruit,</span><br/>

<span>That dog and bear are to dispute;</span><br/>

<span>For so of late men fighting name,</span><br/>

<span>Because they often prove the same;</span><br/>

<span>(For where the first does hap to be,                          725</span><br/>

<span>The last does coincidere;)</span><br/>

<span>Quantum in nobis, have thought good,</span><br/>

<span>To save th' expence of Christian blood,</span><br/>

<span>And try if we, by mediation</span><br/>

<span>Of treaty and accommodation,                                  730</span><br/>

<span>Can end the quarrel and compose</span><br/>

<span>The bloody duel without blows.</span><br/>

<span>Are not our liberties, our lives,</span><br/>

<span>The laws, religion and our wives,</span><br/>

<span>Enough at once to lie at stake                                735</span><br/>

<span>For Cov'nant and the Cause's sake?</span><br/>

<span>But in that quarrel dogs and bears,</span><br/>

<span>As well as we must venture theirs</span><br/>

<span>This feud, by Jesuits invented,</span><br/>

<span>By evil counsel is fomented:                                  740</span><br/>

<span>There is a MACHIAVILIAN plot,</span><br/>

<span>(Tho' ev'ry Nare olfact is not,)</span><br/>

<span>A deep design in't, to divide</span><br/>

<span>The well-affected that confide,</span><br/>

<span>By setting brother against brother,                           745</span><br/>

<span>To claw and curry one another.</span><br/>

<span>Have we not enemies plus satis,</span><br/>

<span>That Cane &amp; Angue pejus hate us?</span><br/>

<span>And shall we turn our fangs and claws</span><br/>

<span>Upon our own selves, without cause?                           750</span><br/>

<span>That some occult design doth lie</span><br/>

<span>In bloody cynarctomachy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-45" id="noteref-45" epub:type="noteref">45</a></span><br/>

<span>Is plain enough to him that knows</span><br/>

<span>How Saints lead brothers by the nose.</span><br/>

<span>I wish myself a pseudo-prophet,                               755</span><br/>

<span>But sure some mischief will come of it;</span><br/>

<span>Unless by providential wit,</span><br/>

<span>Or force, we averruncate it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-46" id="noteref-46" epub:type="noteref">46</a></span><br/>

<span>For what design, what interest,</span><br/>

<span>Can beast have to encounter beast?                            760</span><br/>

<span>They fight for no espoused cause,</span><br/>

<span>Frail privilege, fundamental laws,</span><br/>

<span>Not for a thorough reformation,</span><br/>

<span>Nor covenant, nor protestation,</span><br/>

<span>Nor liberty of consciences,                                   765</span><br/>

<span>Nor Lords and Commons ordinances;</span><br/>

<span>Nor for the church, nor for church-lands,</span><br/>

<span>To get them in their own no hands;</span><br/>

<span>Nor evil counsellors to bring</span><br/>

<span>To justice that seduce the King;                              770</span><br/>

<span>Nor for the worship of us men,</span><br/>

<span>Though we have done as much for them.</span><br/>

<span>Th' AEgyptians worshipp'd dogs, and for</span><br/>

<span>Their faith made internecine war.</span><br/>

<span>Others ador'd a rat, and some                                 775</span><br/>

<span>For that church suffer'd martyrdom.</span><br/>

<span>The Indians fought for the truth</span><br/>

<span>Of th' elephant and monkey's tooth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-47" id="noteref-47" epub:type="noteref">47</a></span><br/>

<span>And many, to defend that faith,</span><br/>

<span>Fought it out mordicus to death.                              780</span><br/>

<span>But no beast ever was so slight,</span><br/>

<span>For man, as for his God, to fight.</span><br/>

<span>They have more wit, alas! and know</span><br/>

<span>Themselves and us better than so.</span><br/>

<span>But we, who only do infuse                                    785</span><br/>

<span>The rage in them like Boute-feus;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-48" id="noteref-48" epub:type="noteref">48</a></span><br/>

<span>'Tis our example that instils</span><br/>

<span>In them th' infection of our ills.</span><br/>

<span>For, as some late philosophers.</span><br/>

<span>Have well observ'd, beasts, that converse                     790</span><br/>

<span>With man, take after him, as hogs</span><br/>

<span>Get pigs all the year, and bitches dogs.</span><br/>

<span>Just so, by our example, cattle</span><br/>

<span>Learn to give one another battle.</span><br/>

<span>We read, in NERO's time, the heathen,                         795</span><br/>

<span>When they destroy'd the Christian brethren,</span><br/>

<span>Did sew them in the skins of bears,</span><br/>

<span>And then set dogs about their ears:</span><br/>

<span>From thence, no doubt, th' invention came</span><br/>

<span>Of this lewd antichristian game.                              800</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>To this, quoth RALPHO, Verily</span><br/>

<span>The point seems very plain to me.</span><br/>

<span>It is an antichristian game,</span><br/>

<span>Unlawful both in thing and name.</span><br/>

<span>First, for the name: the word, bear-baiting                   805</span><br/>

<span>Is carnal, and of man's creating:</span><br/>

<span>For certainly there's no such word</span><br/>

<span>In all the scripture on record;</span><br/>

<span>Therefore unlawful, and a sin;</span><br/>

<span>And so is (secondly) the thing.                               810</span><br/>

<span>A vile assembly 'tis, that can</span><br/>

<span>No more be prov'd by scripture than</span><br/>

<span>Provincial, classic, national;</span><br/>

<span>Mere human-creature cobwebs all.</span><br/>

<span>Thirdly, it is idolatrous;                                    815</span><br/>

<span>For when men run a whoring thus</span><br/>

<span>With their inventions, whatsoe'er</span><br/>

<span>The thing be, whether dog or bear,</span><br/>

<span>It is idolatrous and pagan,</span><br/>

<span>No less than worshipping of DAGON.                            820</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth HUDIBRAS, I smell a rat;</span><br/>

<span>RALPHO, thou dost prevaricate:</span><br/>

<span>For though the thesis which thou lay'st</span><br/>

<span>Be true ad amussim, as thou say'st;</span><br/>

<span>(For that bear-baiting should appear                          825</span><br/>

<span>Jure divino lawfuller</span><br/>

<span>Than synods are, thou dost deny,</span><br/>

<span>Totidem verbis; so do I;)</span><br/>

<span>Yet there's a fallacy in this;</span><br/>

<span>For if by sly HOMAEOSIS,                                      830</span><br/>

<span>Tussis pro crepitu, an art</span><br/>

<span>Under a cough to slur a f—t</span><br/>

<span>Thou wou'dst sophistically imply,</span><br/>

<span>Both are unlawful, I deny.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>And I (quoth RALPHO) do not doubt                             835</span><br/>

<span>But bear-baiting may be made out,</span><br/>

<span>In gospel-times, as lawful as is</span><br/>

<span>Provincial or parochial classis;</span><br/>

<span>And that both are so near of kin,</span><br/>

<span>And like in all, as well as sin,                              840</span><br/>

<span>That put them in a bag, and shake 'em,</span><br/>

<span>Yourself o' th' sudden would mistake 'em,</span><br/>

<span>And not know which is which, unless</span><br/>

<span>You measure by their wickedness:</span><br/>

<span>For 'tis not hard t'imagine whether                           845</span><br/>

<span>O' th' two is worst; tho' I name neither.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth HUDIBRAS, Thou offer'st much,</span><br/>

<span>But art not able to keep touch.</span><br/>

<span>Mira de lente, as 'tis i' th' adage,</span><br/>

<span>Id est, to make a leek a cabbage;                             850</span><br/>

<span>Thou'lt be at best but such a bull,</span><br/>

<span>Or shear-swine, all cry, and no wool;</span><br/>

<span>For what can synods have at all</span><br/>

<span>With bear that's analogical?</span><br/>

<span>Or what relation has debating                                 855</span><br/>

<span>Of church-affairs with bear-baiting?</span><br/>

<span>A just comparison still is</span><br/>

<span>Of things ejusdem generis;</span><br/>

<span>And then what genus rightly doth</span><br/>

<span>Include and comprehend them both?                             860</span><br/>

<span>If animal both of us may</span><br/>

<span>As justly pass for bears as they;</span><br/>

<span>For we are animals no less,</span><br/>

<span>Altho' of different specieses.</span><br/>

<span>But, RALPHO, this is not fit place                            865</span><br/>

<span>Nor time to argue out the case:</span><br/>

<span>For now the field is not far off,</span><br/>

<span>Where we must give the world a proof</span><br/>

<span>Of deeds, not words, and such as suit</span><br/>

<span>Another manner of dispute;                                    870</span><br/>

<span>A controversy that affords</span><br/>

<span>Actions for arguments, not words;</span><br/>

<span>Which we must manage at a rate</span><br/>

<span>Of prowess and conduct adequate</span><br/>

<span>To what our place and fame doth promise,                      875</span><br/>

<span>And all the godly expect from us,</span><br/>

<span>Nor shall they be deceiv'd, unless</span><br/>

<span>We're slurr'd and outed by success;</span><br/>

<span>Success, the mark no mortal wit,</span><br/>

<span>Or surest hand can always hit:                                880</span><br/>

<span>For whatsoe'er we perpetrate,</span><br/>

<span>We do but row, we're steer'd by Fate,</span><br/>

<span>Which in success oft disinherits,</span><br/>

<span>For spurious causes, noblest merits.</span><br/>

<span>Great actions are not always true sons                        885</span><br/>

<span>Of great and mighty resolutions;</span><br/>

<span>Nor do th' boldest attempts bring forth</span><br/>

<span>Events still equal to their worth;</span><br/>

<span>But sometimes fail, and, in their stead,</span><br/>

<span>Fortune and cowardice succeed.                                890</span><br/>

<span>Yet we have no great cause to doubt;</span><br/>

<span>Our actions still have borne us out;</span><br/>

<span>Which tho' they're known to be so ample,</span><br/>

<span>We need not copy from example.</span><br/>

<span>We're not the only persons durst                              895</span><br/>

<span>Attempt this province, nor the first.</span><br/>

<span>In northern clime a val'rous Knight</span><br/>

<span>Did whilom kill his bear in fght,</span><br/>

<span>And wound a fiddler; we have both</span><br/>

<span>Of these the objects of our wroth,                            900</span><br/>

<span>And equal fame and glory from</span><br/>

<span>Th' attempt of victory to come.</span><br/>

<span>'Tis sung, there is a valiant Mamaluke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-49" id="noteref-49" epub:type="noteref">49</a></span><br/>

<span>In foreign land, yclep'd —</span><br/>

<span>To whom we have been oft compar'd                             905</span><br/>

<span>For person, parts; address, and beard;</span><br/>

<span>Both equally reputed stout,</span><br/>

<span>And in the same cause both have fought:</span><br/>

<span>He oft in such attempts as these</span><br/>

<span>Came off with glory and success;                              910</span><br/>

<span>Nor will we fail in th' execution,</span><br/>

<span>For want of equal resolution.</span><br/>

<span>Honour is like a widow, won<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-50" id="noteref-50" epub:type="noteref">50</a></span><br/>

<span>With brisk attempt and putting on;</span><br/>

<span>With ent'ring manfully, and urging;                           915</span><br/>

<span>Not slow approaches, like a virgin.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>'Tis said, as yerst the Phrygian Knight,</span><br/>

<span>So ours with rusty steel did smite</span><br/>

<span>His Trojan horse, and just as much</span><br/>

<span>He mended pace upon the touch;                                920</span><br/>

<span>But from his empty stomach groan'd</span><br/>

<span>Just as that hollow beast did sound,</span><br/>

<span>And angry answer'd from behind,</span><br/>

<span>With brandish'd tail and blast of wind.</span><br/>

<span>So have I seen, with armed heel,                              925</span><br/>

<span>A wight bestride a Common-weal;</span><br/>

<span>While still the more he kick'd and spurr'd,</span><br/>

<span>The less the sullen jade has stirr'd.</span><br/>
