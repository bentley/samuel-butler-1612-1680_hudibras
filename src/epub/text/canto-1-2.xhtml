<p>THERE was an ancient sage philosopher,<br/>

That had read ALEXANDER Ross over,<br/>

And swore the world, as he cou'd prove,<br/>

Was made of fighting and of love:<br/>

Just so romances are; for what else                             5<br/>

Is in them all, but love and battels?<br/>

O' th' first of these we've no great matter<br/>

To treat of, but a world o' th' latter;<br/>

In which to do the injur'd right<br/>

We mean, in what concerns just fight.                          10<br/>

Certes our authors are to blame,<br/>

For to make some well-sounding name<br/>

A pattern fit for modern Knights<br/>

To copy out in frays and fights;<br/>

Like those that a whole street do raze                         15<br/>

To build a palace in the place.<br/>

They never care how many others<br/>

They kill, without regard of mothers,<br/>

Or wives, or children, so they can<br/>

Make up some fierce, dead-doing man,                           20<br/>

Compos'd of many ingredient valors,<br/>

Just like the manhood of nine taylors.<br/>

So a Wild Tartar, when he spies<br/>

A man that's handsome, valiant, wise,<br/>

If he can kill him, thinks t' inherit                          25<br/>

His wit, his beauty, and his spirit<br/>

As if just so much he enjoy'd<br/>

As in another is destroy'd<br/>

For when a giant's slain in fight,<br/>

And mow'd o'erthwart, or cleft down right,                     30<br/>

It is a heavy case, no doubt;<br/>

A man should have his brains beat out<br/>

Because he's tall, and has large bones;<br/>

As men kill beavers for their stones.<br/>

But as for our part, we shall tell                             35<br/>

The naked truth of what befel;<br/>

And as an equal friend to both<br/>

The Knight and Bear, but more to troth,<br/>

With neither faction shall take part,<br/>

But give to each his due desert;                               40<br/>

And never coin a formal lie on't,<br/>

To make the Knight o'ercome the giant.<br/>

This b'ing profest, we've hopes enough,<br/>

And now go on where we left off.<br/>
</p>

<p>They rode; but authors having not                              45<br/>

Determin'd whether pace or trot,<br/>

(That is to say, whether tollutation,<br/>

As they do term't, or succussation,)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-51" id="noteref-51" epub:type="noteref">51</a><br/>

We leave it, and go on, as now<br/>

Suppose they did, no matter how;                               50<br/>

Yet some from subtle hints have got<br/>

Mysterious light, it was a trot:<br/>

But let that pass: they now begun<br/>

To spur their living-engines on.<br/>

For as whipp'd tops, and bandy'd balls,                        55<br/>

The learned hold, are animals;<br/>

So horses they affirm to be<br/>

Mere engines made by geometry;<br/>

And were invented first from engines,<br/>

As Indian Britons were from Penguins.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-52" id="noteref-52" epub:type="noteref">52</a>                      60<br/>

So let them be; and, as I was saying,<br/>

They their live engines ply'd, not staying<br/>

Until they reach'd the fatal champain,<br/>

Which th' enemy did then encamp on;<br/>

The dire Pharsalian plain, where battle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-53" id="noteref-53" epub:type="noteref">53</a>                    65<br/>

Was to be wag'd 'twixt puissant cattle<br/>

And fierce auxiliary men,<br/>

That came to aid their brethren,<br/>

Who now began to take the field,<br/>

As Knight from ridge of steed beheld.                          70<br/>

For as our modern wits behold,<br/>

Mounted a pick-back on the old,<br/>

Much further oft; much further he,<br/>

Rais'd on his aged beast cou'd see;<br/>

Yet not sufficient to descry                                   75<br/>

All postures of the enemy;<br/>

Wherefore he bids the Squire ride further,<br/>

T' observe their numbers, and their order;<br/>

That when their motions he had known<br/>

He might know how to fit his own.                              80<br/>

Meanwhile he stopp'd his willing steed,<br/>

To fit himself for martial deed.<br/>

Both kinds of metal he prepar'd,<br/>

Either to give blows, or to ward:<br/>

Courage and steel, both of great force,                        85<br/>

Prepar'd for better, or for worse.<br/>

His death-charg'd pistols he did fit well,<br/>

Drawn out from life-preserving vittle.<br/>

These being prim'd, with force he labour'd<br/>

To free's sword from retentive scabbard                        90<br/>

And, after many a painful pluck,<br/>

From rusty durance he bail'd tuck.<br/>

Then shook himself, to see that prowess<br/>

In scabbard of his arms sat loose;<br/>

And, rais'd upon his desp'rate foot,                           95<br/>

On stirrup-side he gaz'd about,<br/>

Portending blood, like blazing star,<br/>

The beacon of approaching war.<br/>

RALPHO rode on with no less speed<br/>

Than Hugo in the forest did;                                  100<br/>

But far more in returning made;<br/>

For now the foe he had survey'd,<br/>

Rang'd as to him they did appear,<br/>

With van, main battle, wings, and rear.<br/>

I' the head of all this warlike rabble,                       105<br/>

CROWDERO march'd, expert and able.<br/>

Instead of trumpet and of drum,<br/>

That makes the warrior's stomach come,<br/>

Whose noise whets valour sharp, like beer<br/>

By thunder turn'd to vinegar,                                 110<br/>

(For if a trumpet sound, or drum beat,<br/>

Who has not a month's mind to combat?)<br/>

A squeaking engine he apply'd<br/>

Unto his neck, on north-east side,<br/>

Just where the hangman does dispose,                          115<br/>

To special friends, the knot of noose:<br/>

For 'tis great grace, when statesmen straight<br/>

Dispatch a friend, let others wait.<br/>

His warped ear hung o'er the strings,<br/>

Which was but souse to chitterlings:                          120<br/>

For guts, some write, e'er they are sodden,<br/>

Are fit for music, or for pudden;<br/>

From whence men borrow ev'ry kind<br/>

Of minstrelsy by string or wind.<br/>

His grisly beard was long and thick,                          125<br/>

With which he strung his fiddle-stick;<br/>

For he to horse-tail scorn'd to owe,<br/>

For what on his own chin did grow.<br/>

Chiron,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-54" id="noteref-54" epub:type="noteref">54</a> the four-legg'd bard, had both<br/>

A beard and tail of his own growth;                           130<br/>

And yet by authors 'tis averr'd,<br/>

He made use only of his beard.<br/>

In Staffordshire, where virtuous worth<br/>

Does raise the minstrelsy, not birth;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-55" id="noteref-55" epub:type="noteref">55</a><br/>

Where bulls do chuse the boldest king,                        135<br/>

And ruler, o'er the men of string;<br/>

(As once in Persia, 'tis said,<br/>

Kings were proclaim'd by a horse that neigh'd;)<br/>

He bravely venturing at a crown,<br/>

By chance of war was beaten down,                             140<br/>

And wounded sore. His leg then broke,<br/>

Had got a deputy of oak:<br/>

For when a shin in fight is cropp'd,<br/>

The knee with one of timber's propp'd,<br/>

Esteem'd more honourable than the other,                      145<br/>

And takes place, though the younger brother.<br/>
</p>

<p>Next march'd brave ORSIN, famous for<br/>

Wise conduct, and success in war:<br/>

A skilful leader, stout, severe,<br/>

Now marshal to the champion bear.                             150<br/>

With truncheon, tipp'd with iron head,<br/>

The warrior to the lists he led;<br/>

With solemn march and stately pace,<br/>

But far more grave and solemn face;<br/>

Grave as the Emperor of Pegu<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-56" id="noteref-56" epub:type="noteref">56</a>                              155<br/>

Or Spanish potentate Don Diego.<br/>

This leader was of knowledge great,<br/>

Either for charge or for retreat.<br/>

He knew when to fall on pell-mell;<br/>

To fall back and retreat as well.                             160<br/>

So lawyers, lest the bear defendant,<br/>

And plaintiff dog, should make an end on't,<br/>

Do stave and tail with writs of error,<br/>

Reverse of judgment, and demurrer,<br/>

To let them breathe a while, and then                         165<br/>

Cry whoop, and set them on agen.<br/>

As ROMULUS a wolf did rear,<br/>

So he was dry-nurs'd by a bear,<br/>

That fed him with the purchas'd prey<br/>

Of many a fierce and bloody fray;                             170<br/>

Bred up, where discipline most rare is,<br/>

In military Garden Paris.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-57" id="noteref-57" epub:type="noteref">57</a><br/>

For soldiers heretofore did grow<br/>

In gardens, just as weeds do now,<br/>

Until some splay-foot politicians                             175<br/>

T'APOLLO offer'd up petitions<br/>

For licensing a new invention<br/>

They'd found out of an antique engine,<br/>

To root out all the weeds that grow<br/>

In public gardens at a blow,                                  180<br/>

And leave th' herbs standing. Quoth Sir Sun,<br/>

My friends, that is not to be done.<br/>

Not done! quoth Statesmen; yes, an't please ye,<br/>

When it's once known, you'll say 'tis easy.<br/>

Why then let's know it, quoth Apollo.                         185<br/>

We'll beat a drum, and they'll all follow.<br/>

A drum! (quoth PHOEBUS;) troth, that's true;<br/>

A pretty invention, quaint and new.<br/>

But though of voice and instrument<br/>

We are the undoubted president,                               190<br/>

We such loud music don't profess:<br/>

The Devil's master of that office,<br/>

Where it must pass, if't be a drum;<br/>

He'll sign it with Cler. Parl. Dom. Com.<br/>

To him apply yourselves, and he                               195<br/>

Will soon dispatch you for his fee.<br/>

They did so; but it prov'd so ill,<br/>

Th' had better let 'em grow there still.<br/>

But to resume what we discoursing<br/>

Were on before, that is, stout ORSIN:                         200<br/>

That which so oft, by sundry writers,<br/>

Has been applied t' almost all fighters,<br/>

More justly may b' ascrib'd to this<br/>

Than any other warrior, (viz.)<br/>

None ever acted both parts bolder,                            205<br/>

Both of a chieftain and a soldier.<br/>

He was of great descent and high<br/>

For splendour and antiquity;<br/>

And from celestial origine<br/>

Deriv'd himself in a right line.                              210<br/>

Not as the ancient heroes did,<br/>

Who, that their base-births might be hid,<br/>

(Knowing they were of doubtful gender,<br/>

And that they came in at a windore)<br/>

Made Jupiter himself and others                               215<br/>

O' th' gods, gallants to their own mothers,<br/>

To get on them a race of champions,<br/>

(Of which old Homer first made Lampoons.)<br/>

ARCTOPHYLAX, in northern spheres<br/>

Was his undoubted ancestor:                                   220<br/>

From him his great forefathers came,<br/>

And in all ages bore his name.<br/>

Learned he was in med'c'nal lore;<br/>

For by his side a pouch he wore,<br/>

Replete with strange Hermetic powder,                         225<br/>

That wounds nine miles point-blank wou'd solder;<br/>

By skilful chemist, with great cost,<br/>

Extracted from a rotten post;<br/>

But of a heav'nlier influence<br/>

Than that which mountebanks dispense;                         230<br/>

Tho' by Promethean fire made,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-58" id="noteref-58" epub:type="noteref">58</a><br/>

As they do quack that drive that trade.<br/>

For as when slovens do amiss<br/>

At others doors, by stool or piss,<br/>

The learned write, a red-hot spit                             235<br/>

B'ing prudently apply'd to it,<br/>

Will convey mischief from the dung<br/>

Unto the part that did the wrong,<br/>

So this did healing; and as sure<br/>

As that did mischief this would cure.                         240<br/>
</p>

<p>Thus virtuous ORSIN was endu'd<br/>

With learning, conduct, fortitude,<br/>

Incomparable: and as the prince<br/>

Of poets, HOMER sung long since<br/>

A skilful leech is better far                                 245<br/>

Than half an hundred men of war,<br/>

So he appear'd; and by his skill,<br/>

No less than dint of sword, cou'd kill<br/>
</p>

<p>The gallant BRUIN march'd next him,<br/>

With visage formidably grim,                                  250<br/>

And rugged as a Saracen,<br/>

Or Turk of Mahomet's own kin;<br/>

Clad in a mantle della guerre<br/>

Of rough impenetrable fur;<br/>

And in his nose, like Indian King,                            255<br/>

He wore, for ornament, a ring;<br/>

About his neck a threefold gorget.<br/>

As rough as trebled leathern target;<br/>

Armed, as heralds cant, and langued;<br/>

Or, as the vulgar say, sharp-fanged.                          260<br/>

For as the teeth in beasts of prey<br/>

Are swords, with which they fight in fray;<br/>

So swords, in men of war, are teeth,<br/>

Which they do eat their vittle with.<br/>

He was by birth, some authors write,                          265<br/>

A Russian; some, a Muscovite;<br/>

And 'mong the Cossacks had been bred;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-59" id="noteref-59" epub:type="noteref">59</a><br/>

Of whom we in diurnals read,<br/>

That serve to fill up pages here,<br/>

As with their bodies ditches there.                           270<br/>

SCRIMANSKY was his cousin-german,<br/>

With whom he serv'd, and fed on vermin;<br/>

And when these fail'd, he'd suck his claws,<br/>

And quarter himself upon his paws.<br/>

And tho' his countrymen, the Huns,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-60" id="noteref-60" epub:type="noteref">60</a>                          275<br/>

Did stew their meat between their bums<br/>

And th' horses backs o'er which they straddle,<br/>

And ev'ry man eat up his saddle;<br/>

He was not half so nice as they,<br/>

But eat it raw when 't came in's way.                         280<br/>

He had trac'd countries far and near,<br/>

More than LE BLANC, the traveller;<br/>

Who writes, he spous'd in India,<br/>

Of noble house, a lady gay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-61" id="noteref-61" epub:type="noteref">61</a><br/>

And got on her a race of worthies,                            285<br/>

As stout as any upon earth is.<br/>

Full many a fight for him between<br/>

TALGOL and ORSIN oft had been<br/>

Each striving to deserve the crown<br/>

Of a sav'd citizen; the one                                   290<br/>

To guard his bear; the other fought<br/>

To aid his dog; both made more stout<br/>

By sev'ral spurs of neighbourhood,<br/>

Church-fellow-membership, and blood<br/>

But TALGOL, mortal foe to cows,                               295<br/>

Never got aught of him but blows;<br/>

Blows, hard and heavy, such as he<br/>

Had lent, repaid with usury.<br/>
</p>

<p>Yet TALGOL was of courage stout,<br/>

And vanquish'd oft'ner than he fought:                        300<br/>

Inur'd to labour, sweat and toil,<br/>

And like a champion shone with oil.<br/>

Right many a widow his keen blade,.<br/>

And many fatherless had made.<br/>

He many a boar and huge dun-cow                               305<br/>

Did, like another Guy, o'erthrow;<br/>

But Guy with him in fight compar'd,<br/>

Had like the boar or dun-cow far'd<br/>

With greater troops of sheep h' had fought<br/>

Than AJAX or bold DON QUIXOTE:                                310<br/>

And many a serpent of fell kind,<br/>

With wings before and stings behind,<br/>

Subdu'd: as poets say, long agone<br/>

Bold Sir GEORGE, St. GEORGE did the dragon.<br/>

Nor engine, nor device polemic,                              315<br/>

Disease, nor doctor epidemic,<br/>

Tho' stor'd with deletory med'cines,<br/>

(Which whosoever took is dead since,)<br/>

E'er sent so vast a colony<br/>

To both the underworlds as he:                                320<br/>

For he was of that noble trade<br/>

That demi-gods and heroes made,<br/>

Slaughter and knocking on the head;.<br/>

The trade to which they all were bred;<br/>

And is, like others, glorious when                            325<br/>

'Tis great and large, but base if mean.<br/>

The former rides in triumph for it;<br/>

The latter in a two-wheel'd chariot<br/>

For daring to profane a thing<br/>

So sacred with vile bungling.                                 330<br/>
</p>

<p>Next these the brave MAGNANO came;<br/>

MAGNANO, great in martial fame.<br/>

Yet when with ORSIN he wag'd fight,<br/>

'Tis sung, he got but little by't.<br/>

Yet he was fierce as forest boar,                             335<br/>

Whose spoils upon his back he wore,<br/>

As thick as AJAX' seven-fold shield,<br/>

Which o'er his brazen arms he held:<br/>

But brass was feeble to resist<br/>

The fury of his armed fist:                                   340<br/>

Nor cou'd the hardest ir'n hold out<br/>

Against his blows, but they wou'd through't.<br/>
</p>

<p>In MAGIC he was deeply read<br/>

As he that made the brazen head;<br/>

Profoundly skill'd in the black art;                          345<br/>

As ENGLISH MERLIN for his heart;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-62" id="noteref-62" epub:type="noteref">62</a><br/>

But far more skilful in the spheres<br/>

Than he was at the sieve and shears.<br/>

He cou'd transform himself in colour<br/>

As like the devil as a collier;                               350<br/>

As like as hypocrites in show<br/>

Are to true saints, or crow to crow.<br/>
</p>

<p>Of WARLIKE ENGINES he was author,<br/>

Devis'd for quick dispatch of slaughter:<br/>

The cannon, blunderbuss, and saker,                           355<br/>

He was th' inventor of, and maker:<br/>

The trumpet, and the kettle-drum,<br/>

Did both from his invention come.<br/>

He was the first that e'er did teach<br/>

To make, and how to stop, a breach.                           360<br/>

A lance he bore with iron pike;<br/>

Th' one half wou'd thrust, the other strike;<br/>

And when their forces he had join'd,<br/>

He scorn'd to turn his parts behind.<br/>
</p>

<p>He TRULLA lov'd; TRULLA, more bright                          365<br/>

Than burnish'd armour of her Knight:<br/>

A bold virago, stout and tall,<br/>

As JOAN of FRANCE, or English MALL.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-63" id="noteref-63" epub:type="noteref">63</a><br/>

Thro' perils both of wind and limb,<br/>

Thro' thick and thin, she follow'd him,                       370<br/>

In ev'ry adventure h' undertook,<br/>

And never him or it forsook.<br/>

At breach of wall, or hedge surprize,<br/>

She shar'd i' th' hazard and the prize:<br/>

At beating quarters up, or forage,                            375<br/>

Behav'd herself with matchless courage;<br/>

And laid about in fight more busily<br/>

Than the Amazonian dame Penthesile.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-64" id="noteref-64" epub:type="noteref">64</a><br/>
</p>

<p>And though some criticks here cry shame,<br/>

And say our authors are to blame,                             380<br/>

That (spite of all philosophers,<br/>

Who hold no females stout, but bears;<br/>

And heretofore did so abhor<br/>

That women should pretend to war,<br/>

'They wou'd not suffer the stoutest dame                      385<br/>

To swear by HERCULES'S name)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-65" id="noteref-65" epub:type="noteref">65</a><br/>

Make feeble ladies, in their works,<br/>

To fight like termagants and Turks;<br/>

To lay their native arms aside,<br/>

 Their modesty, and ride astride;                             390<br/>

 To run a-tilt at men, and wield<br/>

 Their naked tools in open field;<br/>

 As stout ARMIDA, bold TRALESTRIS,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-66" id="noteref-66" epub:type="noteref">66</a><br/>

 And she that wou'd have been the mistress<br/>

 Of GUNDIBERT;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-67" id="noteref-67" epub:type="noteref">67</a> but he had grace,                          395<br/>

And rather took a country lass;<br/>

They say, 'tis false, without all sense,<br/>

But of pernicious consequence<br/>

To government, which they suppose<br/>

Can never be upheld in prose;                                 400<br/>

Strip nature naked to the skin,<br/>

You'll find about her no such thing.<br/>

It may be so; yet what we tell<br/>

Of TRULLA that's improbable,<br/>

Shall be depos'd by those who've seen't,                      405<br/>

Or, what's as good, produc'd in print:<br/>

And if they will not take our word,<br/>

We'll prove it true upon record.<br/>
</p>

<p>The upright CERDON next advanc't,<br/>

Of all his race the valiant'st:                               410<br/>

CERDON the Great, renown'd in song,<br/>

Like HERC'LES, for repair of wrong:<br/>

He rais'd the low, and fortify'd<br/>

The weak against the strongest side:<br/>

Ill has he read, that never hit                               415<br/>

On him in Muses' deathless writ.<br/>

He had a weapon keen and fierce,<br/>

That through a bull-hide shield wou'd pierce,<br/>

And cut it in a thousand pieces,                              420<br/>

Tho' tougher than the Knight of Greece his,<br/>

With whom his black-thumb'd ancestor<br/>

Was comrade in the ten years war:<br/>

For when the restless Greeks sat down<br/>

So many years before Troy town,                               425<br/>

And were renown'd, as HOMER writes,<br/>

For well-soal'd boots no less than fights,<br/>

They ow'd that glory only to<br/>

His ancestor, that made them so.<br/>

Fast friend he was to REFORMATION,                            430<br/>

Until 'twas worn quite out of fashion.<br/>

Next rectifier of wry LAW,<br/>

And wou'd make three to cure one flaw.<br/>

Learned he was, and could take note,<br/>

Transcribe, collect, translate, and quote.                    435<br/>

But PREACHING was his chiefest talent,<br/>

Or argument, in which b'ing valiant,<br/>

He us'd to lay about and stickle,<br/>

Like ram or bull, at conventicle:<br/>

For disputants, like rams and bulls,                          440<br/>

Do fight with arms that spring from skulls.<br/>
</p>

<p>Last COLON came, bold man of war,<br/>

Destin'd to blows by fatal star;<br/>

Right expert in command of horse;<br/>

But cruel, and without remorse.                               445<br/>

That which of CENTAUR long ago<br/>

Was said, and has been wrested to<br/>

Some other knights, was true of this;<br/>

He and his horse were of a piece.<br/>

One spirit did inform them both;                              450<br/>

The self-same vigour, fury, wroth:<br/>

Yet he was much the rougher part,<br/>

And always had a harder heart;<br/>

Although his horse had been of those<br/>

That fed on man's flesh, as fame goes.                        455<br/>

Strange food for horse! and yet, alas!<br/>

It may be true, for flesh is grass.<br/>

Sturdy he was, and no less able<br/>

Than HERCULES to clean a stable;<br/>

As great a drover, and as great                               460<br/>

A critic too, in hog or neat.<br/>

He ripp'd the womb up of his mother,<br/>

Dame Tellus, 'cause she wanted fother<br/>

And provender wherewith to feed<br/>

Himself, and his less cruel steed.                            465<br/>

It was a question, whether he<br/>

Or's horse were of a family<br/>

More worshipful: 'till antiquaries<br/>

(After th' had almost por'd out their eyes)<br/>

Did very learnedly decide                                     470<br/>

The business on the horse's side;<br/>

And prov'd not only horse, but cows,<br/>

Nay, pigs, were of the elder house:<br/>

For beasts, when man was but a piece<br/>

Of earth himself, did th' earth possess.                      475<br/>
</p>

<p>These worthies were the chief that led<br/>

The combatants, each in the head<br/>

Of his command, with arms and rage,<br/>

Ready and longing to engage.<br/>

The numerous rabble was drawn out                             480<br/>

Of sev'ral counties round about,<br/>

From villages remote, and shires,<br/>

Of east and western hemispheres<br/>

From foreign parishes and regions,<br/>

Of different manners, speech, religions,                      485<br/>

Came men and mastiffs; some to fight<br/>

For fame and honour, some for sight.<br/>

And now the field of death, the lists,<br/>

Were enter'd by antagonists,<br/>

And blood was ready to be broach'd,                           490<br/>

When HUDIBRAS in haste approach'd,<br/>

With Squire and weapons, to attack 'em:<br/>

But first thus from his horse bespake 'em:<br/>

What rage, O citizens! what fury<br/>

Doth you to these dire actions hurry?                         495<br/>

What oestrum, what phrenetic mood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-68" id="noteref-68" epub:type="noteref">68</a><br/>

Makes you thus lavish of your blood,<br/>

While the proud Vies your trophies boast<br/>

And unreveng'd walks — ghost?<br/>

What towns, what garrisons might you                          500<br/>

With hazard of this blood subdue,<br/>

Which now y'are bent to throw away<br/>

In vain, untriumphable fray!<br/>

Shall SAINTS in civil bloodshed wallow<br/>

Of Saints, and let the CAUSE lie fallow?                      505<br/>

The Cause for which we fought and swore<br/>

So boldly, shall we now give o'er?<br/>

Then, because quarrels still are seen<br/>

With oaths and swearings to begin,<br/>

The SOLEMN LEAGUE and COVENANT                                510<br/>

Will seem a mere God-dam-me rant;<br/>

And we, that took it, and have fought,<br/>

As lewd as drunkards that fall out.<br/>

For as we make war for the King<br/>

Against himself the self-same thing,                          515<br/>

Some will not stick to swear we do<br/>

For God and for Religion too:<br/>

For if bear-baiting we allow,<br/>

What good can Reformation do?<br/>

The blood and treasure that's laid out,                       520<br/>

Is thrown away, and goes for nought.<br/>

Are these the fruits o' th' PROTESTATION,<br/>

The Prototype of Reformation,<br/>

Which all the Saints, and some, since Martyrs,<br/>

Wore in their hats like wedding garters,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-69" id="noteref-69" epub:type="noteref">69</a>                  525<br/>

When 'twas resolv'd by either house<br/>

Six Members quarrel to espouse?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-70" id="noteref-70" epub:type="noteref">70</a><br/>

Did they for this draw down the rabble,<br/>

With zeal and noises formidable,<br/>

And make all cries about the town                             530<br/>

Join throats to cry the Bishops down?<br/>

Who having round begirt the palace,<br/>

(As once a month they do the gallows,)<br/>

As members gave the sign about,<br/>

Set up their throats with hideous shout.                      535<br/>

When tinkers bawl'd aloud to settle<br/>

Church discipline, for patching kettle:<br/>

No sow-gelder did blow his horn<br/>

To geld a cat, but cry'd, Reform.<br/>

The oyster-women lock'd their fish up,                        540<br/>

And trudg'd away, to cry, No Bishop.<br/>

The mouse-trap men laid save-alls by,<br/>

And 'gainst Ev'l Counsellors did cry.<br/>

Botchers left old cloaths in the lurch,<br/>

And fell to turn and patch the Church.                        545<br/>

Some cry'd the Covenant instead<br/>

Of pudding-pies and ginger-bread;<br/>

And some for brooms, old boots and shoes,<br/>

Bawl'd out to Purge the Commons House.<br/>

Instead of kitchen-stuff, some cry,                           550<br/>

A Gospel-preaching Ministry;<br/>

And some, for old suits, coats, or cloak,<br/>

No Surplices nor Service-Book.<br/>

A strange harmonious inclination<br/>

Of all degrees to Reformation.                                555<br/>

And is this all? Is this the end<br/>

To which these carr'ings on did tend?<br/>

Hath public faith, like a young heir,<br/>

For this ta'en up all sorts of ware,<br/>

And run int' every tradesman's book,                          560<br/>

'Till both turn'd bankrupts, and are broke?<br/>

Did Saints for this bring in their plate,<br/>

And crowd as if they came too late?<br/>

For when they thought the Cause had need on't,<br/>

Happy was he that could be rid on't.                          565<br/>

Did they coin piss-pots, bowls, and flaggons,<br/>

Int' officers of horse and dragoons;<br/>

And into pikes and musquetteers<br/>

Stamp beakers, cups, and porringers!<br/>

A thimble, bodkin, and a spoon,                               570<br/>

Did start up living men as soon<br/>

As in the furnace they were thrown,<br/>

Just like the dragon's teeth b'ing sown.<br/>

Then was the Cause of gold and plate,<br/>

The Brethren's off'rings, consecrate,                         575<br/>

Like th' Hebrew calf, and down before it<br/>

The Saints fell prostrate, to adore it<br/>

So say the wicked — and will you<br/>

Make that sarcasmus scandal true,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-71" id="noteref-71" epub:type="noteref">71</a><br/>

By running after dogs and bears?                              580<br/>

Beasts more unclean than calves or steers.<br/>

Have pow'rful Preachers ply'd their tongues,<br/>

And laid themselves out and their lungs;<br/>

Us'd all means, both direct and sinister,<br/>

I' th' pow'r of Gospel-preaching Minister?                    585<br/>

Have they invented tones to win<br/>

The women, and make them draw in<br/>

The men, as Indians with a female<br/>

Tame elephant inveigle the male?<br/>

Have they told Prov'dence what it must do,                    590<br/>

Whom to avoid, and whom to trust to?<br/>

Discover'd th' enemy's design,<br/>

And which way best to countermine?<br/>

Prescrib'd what ways it hath to work,<br/>

Or it will ne'er advance the Kirk?                            595<br/>

Told it the news o' th' last express,<br/>

And after good or bad success,<br/>

Made prayers, not so like petitions,<br/>

As overtures and propositions,<br/>

(Such as the army did present                                 600<br/>

To their creator, th' Parliament,)<br/>

In which they freely will confess<br/>

They will not, cannot acquiesce,<br/>

Unless the work be carry'd on<br/>

In the same way they have begun,                              605<br/>

By setting Church and Common-weal<br/>

All on a flame, bright as their zeal,<br/>

On which the Saints were all a-gog,<br/>

And all this for a bear and dog?<br/>

The parliament drew up petitions                              610<br/>

To itself, and sent them, like commissions,<br/>

To well-affected persons down,<br/>

In ev'ry city and great town,<br/>

With pow'r to levy horse and men,<br/>

Only to bring them back agen:                                 615<br/>

For this did many, many a mile,<br/>

Ride manfully in rank and file,<br/>

With papers in their hats, that show'd<br/>

As if they to the pillory rode.<br/>

Have all these courses, these efforts,                        620<br/>

Been try'd by people of all sorts,<br/>

Velis &amp; remis, omnibus nervis<br/>

And all t'advance the Cause's service?<br/>

And shall all now be thrown, away<br/>

In petulant intestine fray?                                   625<br/>

Shall we that in the Cov'nant swore,<br/>

Each man of us to run before<br/>

Another, still in Reformation,<br/>

Give dogs and bears a dispensation?<br/>

How will Dissenting Brethren relish it?                       630<br/>

What will malignants say? videlicet,<br/>

That each man Swore to do his best,<br/>

To damn and perjure all the rest!<br/>

And bid the Devil take the hin'most,<br/>

Which at this race is like to win most.                       635<br/>

They'll say our bus'ness, to reform<br/>

The Church and State, is but a worm;<br/>

For to subscribe, unsight, unseen,<br/>

To an unknown Church-discipline,<br/>

What is it else, but before-hand                              640<br/>

T'engage, and after understand?<br/>

For when we swore to carry on<br/>

The present Reformation,<br/>

According to the purest mode<br/>

Of Churches best reformed abroad,                             645<br/>

What did we else, but make a vow<br/>

To do we know not what, nor how?<br/>

For no three of us will agree,<br/>

Where or what Churches these should be;<br/>

And is indeed the self-same case                          650<br/>

With theirs that swore et caeteras;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-72" id="noteref-72" epub:type="noteref">72</a><br/>

Or the French League, in which men vow'd<br/>

To fight to the last drop of blood.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-73" id="noteref-73" epub:type="noteref">73</a><br/>

These slanders will be thrown upon<br/>

The Cause and Work we carry on,                               655<br/>

If we permit men to run headlong<br/>

T' exorbitances fit for Bedlam<br/>

Rather than Gospel-walking times,<br/>

When slightest sins are greatest crimes.<br/>

But we the matter so shall handle,                            660<br/>

As to remove that odious scandal.<br/>

In name of King and parliament,<br/>

I charge ye all; no more foment<br/>

This feud, but keep the peace between<br/>

Your brethren and your countrymen;                            665<br/>

And to those places straight repair<br/>

Where your respective dwellings are.<br/>

But to that purpose first surrender<br/>

The FIDDLER, as the prime offender,<br/>

Th' incendiary vile, that is chief                            670<br/>

Author and engineer of mischief;<br/>

That makes division between friends,<br/>

For profane and malignant ends.<br/>

He, and that engine of vile noise,<br/>

On which illegally he plays,                                  675<br/>

Shall (dictum factum) both be brought<br/>

To condign punishment, as they ought.<br/>

This must be done; and I would fain see<br/>

Mortal so sturdy as to gain-say:<br/>

For then I'll take another course,                            680<br/>

And soon reduce you all by force.<br/>

This said, he clapp'd his hand on sword,<br/>

To shew he meant to keep his word.<br/>
</p>

<p>But TALGOL, who had long supprest<br/>

Inflamed wrath in glowing, breast,                            685<br/>

Which now began to rage and burn as<br/>

Implacably as flame in furnace,<br/>

Thus answer'd him: — Thou vermin wretched<br/>

As e'er in measled pork was hatched;<br/>

Thou tail of worship, that dost grow                          690<br/>

On rump of justice as of cow;<br/>

How dar'st thou, with that sullen luggage<br/>

O' th' self, old ir'n, and other baggage,<br/>

With which thy steed of bones and leather<br/>

Has broke his wind in halting hither;                         695<br/>

How durst th', I say, adventure thus<br/>

T' oppose thy lumber against us?<br/>

Could thine impertinence find out<br/>

To work t' employ itself about,<br/>

Where thou, secure from wooden blow,                          700<br/>

Thy busy vanity might'st show?<br/>

Was no dispute a-foot between<br/>

The caterwauling Brethren?<br/>

No subtle question rais'd among                               705<br/>

Those out-o-their wits, and those i' th' wrong;<br/>

No prize between those combatants<br/>

O' th' times, the Land and Water Saints;<br/>

Where thou might'st stickle without hazard<br/>

Of outrage to thy hide and mazzard;<br/>

And not for want of bus'ness come                             710<br/>

To us to be so troublesome,<br/>

To interrupt our better sort<br/>

Of disputants, and spoil our sport?<br/>

Was there no felony, no bawd,<br/>

Cut-purse, no burglary abroad;                                715<br/>

No stolen pig, nor plunder'd goose,<br/>

To tie thee up from breaking loose?<br/>

No ale unlicens'd, broken hedge,<br/>

For which thou statute might'st alledge,<br/>

To keep thee busy from foul evil,                             720<br/>

And shame due to thee from the Devil?<br/>

Did no committee sit, where he<br/>

Might cut out journey-work for thee?<br/>

And set th' a task, with subornation,<br/>

To stitch up sale and sequestration;                          725<br/>

To cheat, with holiness and zeal,<br/>

All parties, and the common-weal?<br/>

Much better had it been for thee,<br/>

H' had kept thee where th' art us'd to be;<br/>

Or sent th' on bus'ness any whither,                          730<br/>

So he had never brought thee hither.<br/>

But if th' hast brain enough in skull<br/>

To keep itself in lodging whole,<br/>

And not provoke the rage of stones<br/>

And cudgels to thy hide and bones                             735<br/>

Tremble, and vanish, while thou may'st,<br/>

Which I'll not promise if thou stay'st.<br/>

At this the Knight grew high in wroth,<br/>

And lifting hands and eyes up both,<br/>

Three times he smote on stomach stout,                        740<br/>

From whence at length these words broke out:<br/>
</p>

<p>Was I for this entitled SIR,<br/>

And girt with trusty sword and spur,<br/>

For fame and honor to wage battle,<br/>

Thus to be brav'd by foe to cattle?                           745<br/>

Not all that pride that makes thee swell<br/>

As big as thou dost blown-up veal;<br/>

Nor all thy tricks and sleights to cheat,<br/>

And sell thy carrion for good meat;<br/>

Not all thy magic to repair                                   750<br/>

Decay'd old age in tough lean ware;<br/>

Make nat'ral appear thy work,<br/>

And stop the gangrene in stale pork;<br/>

Not all that force that makes thee proud,<br/>

Because by bullock ne'er withstood;                           755<br/>

Though arm'd with all thy cleavers, knives,<br/>

And axes made to hew down lives,<br/>

Shall save or help thee to evade<br/>

The hand of Justice, or this blade,<br/>

Which I, her sword-bearer, do carry,                          760<br/>

For civil deed and military.<br/>

Nor shall those words of venom base,<br/>

Which thou hast from their native place,<br/>

Thy stomach, pump'd to fling on me,<br/>

Go unreveng'd, though I am free:                              765<br/>

Thou down the same throat shalt devour 'em,<br/>

Like tainted beef, and pay dear for 'em.<br/>

Nor shall it e'er be said, that wight<br/>

With gantlet blue, and bases white,<br/>

And round blunt truncheon by his side,                        770<br/>

So great a man at arms defy'd<br/>

With words far bitterer than wormwood,<br/>

That would in Job or Grizel stir mood.<br/>

Dogs with their tongues their wounds do heal;<br/>

But men with hands, as thou shalt feel.                       775<br/>
</p>

<p>This said, with hasty rage he snatch'd<br/>

His gun-shot, that in holsters watch'd;<br/>

And bending cock, he levell'd full<br/>

Against th' outside of TALGOL'S skull;<br/>

Vowing that he shou'd ne'er stir further,                     780<br/>

Nor henceforth cow nor bullock murther.<br/>

But PALLAS came in shape of rust,<br/>

And 'twixt the spring and hammerthrust<br/>

Her Gorgon shield, which made the cock<br/>

Stand stiff, as t'were transform'd to stock.                  785<br/>

Mean while fierce TALGOL, gath'ring might,<br/>

With rugged truncheon charg'd the Knight;<br/>

But he with petronel upheav'd,<br/>

Instead of shield, the blow receiv'd.<br/>

The gun recoil'd, as well it might,                           790<br/>

Not us'd to such a kind of fight,<br/>

And shrunk from its great master's gripe,<br/>

Knock'd down and stunn'd by mortal stripe.<br/>

Then HUDIBRAS, with furious haste,<br/>

Drew out his sword; yet not so fast,                          795<br/>

But TALGOL first, with hardy thwack,<br/>

Twice bruis'd his head, and twice his back.<br/>

But when his nut-brown sword was out,<br/>

With stomach huge he laid about,<br/>

Imprinting many a wound upon                                  800<br/>

His mortal foe, the truncheon.<br/>

The trusty cudgel did oppose<br/>

Itself against dead-doing blows,<br/>

To guard its leader from fell bane,<br/>

And then reveng'd itself again.                               805<br/>

And though the sword (some understood)<br/>

In force had much the odds of wood,<br/>

'Twas nothing so; both sides were ballanc't<br/>

So equal, none knew which was valiant'st:<br/>

For wood with Honour b'ing engag'd,                           810<br/>

Is so implacably enrag'd,<br/>

Though iron hew and mangle sore,<br/>

Wood wounds and bruises Honour more.<br/>

And now both Knights were out of breath,<br/>

Tir'd in the hot pursuit of death;                            815<br/>

While all the rest amaz'd stood still,<br/>

Expecting which should take or kill.<br/>

This HUDIBRAS observ'd; and fretting<br/>

Conquest should be so long a getting,<br/>

He drew up all his force into                                 820<br/>

One body, and that into one blow.<br/>

But TALGOL wisely avoided it<br/>

By cunning sleight; for had it hit,<br/>

The upper part of him the blow<br/>

Had slit as sure as that below.                               825<br/>
</p>

<p>Meanwhile th' incomparable COLON,<br/>

To aid his friend, began to fall on.<br/>

Him RALPH encounter'd, and straight grew<br/>

A dismal combat 'twixt them two:<br/>

Th' one arm'd with metal, th' other with wood;                830<br/>

This fit for bruise, and that for blood.<br/>

With many a stiff thwack, many a bang,<br/>

Hard crab-tree and old iron rang;<br/>

While none that saw them cou'd divine<br/>

To which side conquest would incline,                         835<br/>

Until MAGNANO, who did envy<br/>

That two should with so many men vie,<br/>

By subtle stratagem of brain,<br/>

Perform'd what force could ne'er attain;<br/>

For he, by foul hap, having found                             840<br/>

Where thistles grew on barren ground,<br/>

In haste he drew his weapon out,<br/>

And having cropp'd them from the root,<br/>

He clapp'd them underneath the tail<br/>

Of steed, with pricks as sharp as nail.                       845<br/>

The angry beast did straight resent<br/>

The wrong done to his fundament;<br/>

Began to kick, and fling, and wince,<br/>

As if h' had been beside his sense,<br/>

Striving to disengage from thistle,                           850<br/>

That gall'd him sorely under his tail:<br/>

Instead of which, he threw the pack<br/>

Of Squire and baggage from his back;<br/>

And blund'ring still with smarting rump,<br/>

He gave the Knight's steed such a thump                       855<br/>

As made him reel. The Knight did stoop,<br/>

And sat on further side aslope.<br/>

This TALGOL viewing, who had now<br/>

By sleight escap'd the fatal blow,<br/>

He rally'd, and again fell to't;                              860<br/>

For catching foe by nearer foot,<br/>

He lifted with such might and strength,<br/>

As would have hurl'd him thrice his length,<br/>

And dash'd his brains (if any) out:<br/>

But MARS, that still protects the stout,                      865<br/>

In pudding-time came to his aid,<br/>

And under him the Bear convey'd;<br/>

The Bear, upon whose soft fur-gown<br/>

The Knight with all his weight fell down.<br/>

The friendly rug preserv'd the ground,                        870<br/>

And headlong Knight, from bruise or wound;<br/>

Like feather-bed betwixt a wall<br/>

And heavy brunt of cannon-ball.<br/>

As Sancho on a blanket fell,<br/>

And had no hurt, our's far'd as well                          875<br/>

In body; though his mighty spirit,<br/>

B'ing heavy, did not so well bear it,<br/>

The Bear was in a greater fright,<br/>

Beat down and worsted by the Knight.<br/>

He roar'd, and rak'd, and flung about,                        880<br/>

To shake off bondage from his snout.<br/>

His wrath inflam'd, boil'd o'er, and from<br/>

His jaws of death he threw the foam:<br/>

Fury in stranger postures threw him,<br/>

And more than herald ever drew him.                           885<br/>

He tore the earth which he had sav'd<br/>

From squelch of Knight, and storm'd and rav'd,<br/>

And vext the more because the harms<br/>

He felt were 'gainst the law of arms:<br/>

For men he always took to be                                  890<br/>

His friends, and dogs the enemy;<br/>

Who never so much hurt had done him,<br/>

As his own side did falling on him.<br/>

It griev'd him to the guts that they<br/>

For whom h' had fought so many a fray,                        895<br/>

And serv'd with loss of blood so long,<br/>

Shou'd offer such inhuman wrong;<br/>

Wrong of unsoldier-like condition;<br/>

For which he flung down his commission;<br/>

And laid about him, till his nose                             900<br/>

From thrall of ring and cord broke loose.<br/>

Soon as he felt himself enlarg'd,<br/>

Through thickest of his foes he charg'd,<br/>

And made way through th' amazed crew;<br/>

Some he o'erran, and some o'erthrew,                          905<br/>

But took none; for by hasty flight<br/>

He strove t' escape pursuit of Knight;<br/>

From whom he fled with as much haste<br/>

And dread as he the rabble chas'd.<br/>

In haste he fled, and so did they;                            910<br/>

Each and his fear a several way.<br/>
</p>

<p>CROWDERO only kept the field;<br/>

Not stirring from the place he held;<br/>

Though beaten down and wounded sore,<br/>

I' th' fiddle, and a leg that bore                            915<br/>

One side of him; not that of bone,<br/>

But much it's better, th' wooden one.<br/>

He spying HUDIBRAS lie strow'd<br/>

Upon the ground, like log of wood,<br/>

With fright of fall, supposed wound,                          920<br/>

And loss of urine, in a swound,<br/>

In haste he snatch'd the wooden limb,<br/>

That hurt i' the ankle lay by him,<br/>

And fitting it for sudden fight,<br/>

Straight drew it up t' attack the Knight;                     925<br/>

For getting up on stump and huckle,<br/>

He with the foe began to buckle;<br/>

Vowing to be reveng'd for breach<br/>

Of crowd and skin upon the wretch,<br/>

Sole author of all detriment                                  930<br/>

He and his fiddle underwent.<br/>
</p>

<p>But RALPHO (who had now begun<br/>

T' adventure resurrection<br/>

From heavy squelch, and had got up<br/>

Upon his legs, with sprained crup)                            935<br/>

Looking about, beheld pernicion<br/>

Approaching Knight from fell musician.<br/>

He snatch'd his whinyard up, that fled<br/>

When he was falling off his steed,<br/>

(As rats do from a falling house,)                            940<br/>

To hide itself from rage of blows;<br/>

And, wing'd with speed and fury, flew<br/>

To rescue Knight from black and blew;<br/>

Which, e'er he cou'd atchieve, his sconce<br/>

The leg encounter'd twice and once;                           945<br/>

And now 'twas rais'd to smite agen,<br/>

When RALPHO thrust himself between.<br/>

He took the blow upon his arm,<br/>

To shield the Knight from further harm;<br/>

And, joining wrath with force, bestow'd                       950<br/>

On th' wooden member such a load,<br/>

That down it fell, and with it bore<br/>

CROWDERO, whom it propp'd before.<br/>

To him the Squire right nimbly run,<br/>

And setting conquering foot upon                              955<br/>

His trunk, thus spoke: What desp'rate frenzy<br/>

Made thee (thou whelp of Sin!) to fancy<br/>

Thyself, and all that coward rabble,<br/>

T' encounter us in battle able?<br/>

How durst th', I say, oppose thy curship                      960<br/>

'Gainst arms, authority, and worship?<br/>

And HUDIBRAS or me provoke,<br/>

Though all thy limbs, were heart of oke,<br/>

And th' other half of thee as good<br/>

To bear out blows, as that of wood?                           965<br/>

Cou'd not the whipping-post prevail<br/>

With all its rhet'ric, nor the jail,<br/>

To keep from flaying scourge thy skin,<br/>

And ankle free from iron gin?<br/>

Which now thou shalt — But first our care                    970<br/>

Must see how HUDIBRAS doth fare.<br/>

This said, he gently rais'd the Knight,<br/>

And set him on his bum upright.<br/>

To rouse him from lethargic dump,<br/>

He tweak'd his nose; with gentle thump                        975<br/>

Knock'd on his breast, as if 't had been<br/>

To raise the spirits lodg'd within.<br/>

They, waken'd with the noise, did fly<br/>

From inward room to window eye,<br/>

And gently op'ning lid, the casement,                         980<br/>

Look'd out, but yet with some amazement.<br/>

This gladded RALPHO much to see,<br/>

Who thus bespoke the Knight: quoth he,<br/>

Tweaking his nose, You are, great Sir,<br/>

A self-denying conqueror;                                     985<br/>

As high, victorious, and great,<br/>

As e'er fought for the Churches yet,<br/>

If you will give yourself but leave<br/>

To make out what y' already have;<br/>

That's victory. The foe, for dread                            990<br/>

Of your nine-worthiness, is fled:<br/>

All, save CROWDERO, for whose sake<br/>

You did th' espous'd Cause undertake;<br/>

And he lies pris'ner at your feet,<br/>

To be dispos'd as you think meet;                             995<br/>

Either for life, or death, or sale,<br/>

The gallows, or perpetual jail;<br/>

For one wink of your powerful eye<br/>

Must sentence him to live or die.<br/>

His fiddle is your proper purchase,                          1000<br/>

Won in the service of the Churches;<br/>

And by your doom must be allow'd<br/>

To be, or be no more, a crowd.<br/>

For though success did not confer<br/>

Just title on the conqueror;                                 1005<br/>

Though dispensations were not strong<br/>

Conclusions, whether right or wrong,<br/>

Although out-goings did confirm,<br/>

And owning were but a mere term;<br/>

Yet as the wicked have no right                              1010<br/>

To th' creature, though usurp'd by might,<br/>

The property is in the Saint,<br/>

From whom th' injuriously detain 't;<br/>

Of him they hold their luxuries,<br/>

Their dogs, their horses, whores, and dice,                  1015<br/>

Their riots, revels, masks, delights,<br/>

Pimps, buffoons, fiddlers, parasites;<br/>

All which the Saints have title to,<br/>

And ought t' enjoy, if th' had their due.<br/>

What we take from them is no more                            1020<br/>

Than what was our's by right before;<br/>

For we are their true landlords still,<br/>

And they our tenants but at will.<br/>

At this the Knight began to rouze,<br/>

And by degrees grow valorous.                                1025<br/>

He star'd about, and seeing none<br/>

Of all his foes remain, but one,<br/>

He snatch'd his weapon, that lay near him,<br/>

And from the ground began to rear him;<br/>

Vowing to make CROWDERO pay                                  1030<br/>

For all the rest that ran away.<br/>

But RALPHO now, in colder blood,<br/>

His fury mildly thus withstood:<br/>

Great Sir, quoth he, your mighty spirit<br/>

Is rais'd too high: this slave does merit                    1035<br/>

To be the hangman's bus'ness, sooner<br/>

Than from your hand to have the honour<br/>

Of his destruction. I, that am<br/>

A nothingness in deed and name<br/>

Did scorn to hurt his forfeit carcase,                       1040<br/>

Or ill intreat his fiddle or case:<br/>

Will you, great Sir, that glory blot<br/>

In cold blood which you gain'd in hot?<br/>

Will you employ your conqu'ring sword<br/>

To break a fiddle and your word?                             1045<br/>

For though I fought, and overcame,<br/>

And quarter gave, 'twas in your name.<br/>

For great commanders only own<br/>

What's prosperous by the soldier done.<br/>

To save, where you have pow'r to kill,                       1050<br/>

Argues your pow'r above your will;<br/>

And that your will and pow'r have less<br/>

Than both might have of selfishness.<br/>

This pow'r which, now alive, with dread<br/>

He trembles at, if he were dead,                             1055<br/>

Wou'd no more keep the slave in awe,<br/>

Than if you were a Knight of straw:<br/>

For death would then be his conqueror;<br/>

Not you, and free him from that terror.<br/>

If danger from his life accrue;                              1060<br/>

Or honour from his death, to you,<br/>

'Twere policy, and honour too,<br/>

To do as you resolv'd to do:<br/>

But, Sir, 'twou'd wrong your valour much,<br/>

To say it needs or fears a crutch.                           1065<br/>

Great conquerors greater glory gain<br/>

By foes in triumph led, than slain:<br/>

The laurels that adorn their brows<br/>

Are pull'd from living not dead boughs,<br/>

And living foes: the greatest fame                           1070<br/>

Of cripple slain can be but lame.<br/>

One half of him's already slain,<br/>

The other is not worth your pain;<br/>

Th' honour can but on one side light,<br/>

As worship did, when y' were dubb'd Knight.                  1075<br/>

Wherefore I think it better far<br/>

To keep him prisoner of war;<br/>

And let him fast in bonds abide,<br/>

At court of Justice to be try'd;<br/>

Where, if he appear so bold and crafty,                      1080<br/>

There may be danger in his safety.<br/>

If any member there dislike<br/>

His face, or to his beard have pique;<br/>

Or if his death will save or yield,<br/>

Revenge or fright, it is reveal'd.                           1085<br/>

Though he has quarter, ne'er the less<br/>

Y' have power to hang him when you please.<br/>

This has been often done by some<br/>

Of our great conqu'rors, you know whom;<br/>

And has by most of us been held                              1090<br/>

Wise Justice, and to some reveal'd.<br/>

For words and promises, that yoke<br/>

The conqueror, are quickly broke;<br/>

Like SAMPSON's cuffs, though by his own<br/>

Direction and advice put on.                                 1095<br/>

For if we should fight for the CAUSE<br/>

By rules of military laws,<br/>

And only do what they call just,<br/>

The Cause would quickly fall to dust.<br/>

This we among ourselves may speak;                           1100<br/>

But to the wicked, or the weak,<br/>

We must be cautious to declare<br/>

Perfection-truths, such as these are.<br/>
</p>

<p>This said, the high outrageous mettle<br/>

Of Knight began to cool and settle.                          1105<br/>

He lik'd the Squire's advice, and soon<br/>

Resolv'd to see the business done<br/>

And therefore charg'd him first to bind<br/>

CROWDERO'S hands on rump behind,<br/>

And to its former place and use,                             1110<br/>

The wooden member to reduce<br/>

But force it take an oath before,<br/>

Ne'er to bear arms against him more.<br/>
</p>

<p>RALPHO dispatch'd with speedy haste,<br/>

And having ty'd CROWDERO fast,                               1115<br/>

He gave Sir Knight the end of cord,<br/>

To lead the captive of his sword<br/>

In triumph, whilst the steeds he caught,<br/>

And them to further service brought.<br/>

The Squire in state rode on before,                          1120<br/>

And on his nut-brown whinyard bore<br/>

The trophee-fiddle and the case,<br/>

Leaning on shoulder like a mace.<br/>

The Knight himself did after ride,<br/>

Leading CROWDERO by his side;                                1125<br/>

And tow'd him, if he lagg'd behind,<br/>

Like boat against the tide and wind.<br/>

Thus grave and solemn they march'd on,<br/>

Until quite thro' the town th' had gone;<br/>

At further end of which there stands                         1130<br/>

An ancient castle, that commands<br/>

Th' adjacent parts: in all the fabrick<br/>

You shall not see one stone nor a brick;<br/>

But all of wood; by pow'rful spell<br/>

Of magic made impregnable.                                   1135<br/>

There's neither iron-bar nor gate,<br/>

Portcullis, chain, nor bolt, nor grate,<br/>

And yet men durance there abide,<br/>

In dungeon scarce three inches wide;<br/>

With roof so low, that under it                              1140<br/>

They never stand, but lie or sit;<br/>

And yet so foul, that whoso is in,<br/>

Is to the middle-leg in prison;<br/>

In circle magical conflu'd,<br/>

With walls of subtile air and wind,                          1145<br/>

Which none are able to break thorough,<br/>

Until they're freed by head of borough.<br/>

Thither arriv'd, th' advent'rous Knight<br/>

And bold Squire from their steeds alight<br/>

At th' outward wall, near which there stands                 1150<br/>

A bastile, built to imprison hands;<br/>

By strange enchantment made to fetter<br/>

The lesser parts and free the greater;<br/>

For though the body may creep through,<br/>

The hands in grate are fast enough:                          1155<br/>

And when a circle 'bout the wrist<br/>

Is made by beadle exorcist,<br/>

The body feels the spur and switch,<br/>

As if 'twere ridden post by witch<br/>

At twenty miles an hour pace,                                1160<br/>

And yet ne'er stirs out of the place.<br/>

On top of this there is a spire,<br/>

On which Sir Knight first bids the Squire<br/>

The fiddle and its spoils, the case,<br/>

In manner of a trophee place.                                1165<br/>

That done, they ope the trap-door gate,<br/>

And let CROWDERO down thereat;<br/>

CROWDERO making doleful face,<br/>

Like hermit poor in pensive place.<br/>

To dungeon they the wretch commit,                           1170<br/>

And the survivor of his feet<br/>

But th' other, that had broke the peace<br/>

And head of Knighthood, they release;<br/>

Though a delinquent false and forged,<br/>

Yet be'ing a stranger, he's enlarged;                        1175<br/>

While his comrade, that did no hurt,<br/>

Is clapp'd up fast in prison for't.<br/>

Stumbles on innocence sometimes.<br/>
