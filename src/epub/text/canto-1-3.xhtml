<span>Ah me! what perils do environ</span><br/>

<span>The man that meddles with cold iron!</span><br/>

<span>What plaguy mischiefs and mishaps</span><br/>

<span>Do dog him still with after-claps!</span><br/>

<span>For though dame Fortune seem to smile                           5</span><br/>

<span>And leer upon him for a while,</span><br/>

<span>She'll after shew him, in the nick</span><br/>

<span>Of all his glories, a dog-trick.</span><br/>

<span>This any man may sing or say,</span><br/>

<span>I' th' ditty call'd, What if a Day?                            10</span><br/>

<span>For HUDIBRAS, who thought h' had won</span><br/>

<span>The field, as certain as a gun;</span><br/>

<span>And having routed the whole troop,</span><br/>

<span>With victory was cock a-hoop;</span><br/>

<span>Thinking h' had done enough to purchase                        15</span><br/>

<span>Thanksgiving-day among the Churches,</span><br/>

<span>Wherein his mettle, and brave worth,</span><br/>

<span>Might be explain'd by Holder-forth,</span><br/>

<span>And register'd, by fame eternal,</span><br/>

<span>In deathless pages of diurnal;                                 20</span><br/>

<span>Found in few minutes, to his cost,</span><br/>

<span>He did but count without his host;</span><br/>

<span>And that a turn-stile is more certain</span><br/>

<span>Than, in events of war, dame Fortune.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>For now the late faint-hearted rout,                           25</span><br/>

<span>O'erthrown, and scatter'd round about,</span><br/>

<span>Chas'd by the horror of their fear</span><br/>

<span>From bloody fray of Knight and Bear,</span><br/>

<span>(All but the dogs, who, in pursuit</span><br/>

<span>Of the Knight's victory, stood to't,                           30</span><br/>

<span>And most ignobly fought to get</span><br/>

<span>The honour of his blood and sweat,)</span><br/>

<span>Seeing the coast was free and clear</span><br/>

<span>O' th' conquer'd and the conqueror,</span><br/>

<span>Took heart again, and fac'd about,                             35</span><br/>

<span>As if they meant to stand it out:</span><br/>

<span>For by this time the routed Bear,</span><br/>

<span>Attack'd by th' enemy i' th' rear,</span><br/>

<span>Finding their number grew too great</span><br/>

<span>For him to make a safe retreat,                                40</span><br/>

<span>Like a bold chieftain, fac'd about;</span><br/>

<span>But wisely doubting to hold out,</span><br/>

<span>Gave way to Fortune, and with haste</span><br/>

<span>Fac'd the proud foe, and fled, and fac'd;</span><br/>

<span>Retiring still, until he found                                 45</span><br/>

<span>H' had got the advantage of the ground;</span><br/>

<span>And then as valiantly made head</span><br/>

<span>To check the foe, and forthwith fled;</span><br/>

<span>Leaving no art untry'd, nor trick</span><br/>

<span>Of warrior stout and politick,                                 50</span><br/>

<span>Until, in spite of hot pursuit,</span><br/>

<span>He gain'd a pass to hold dispute</span><br/>

<span>On better terms, and stop the course</span><br/>

<span>Of the proud foe. With all his force</span><br/>

<span>He bravely charg'd, and for a while                            55</span><br/>

<span>Forc'd their whole body to recoil;</span><br/>

<span>But still their numbers so increas'd,</span><br/>

<span>He found himself at length oppress'd,</span><br/>

<span>And all evasions, so uncertain,</span><br/>

<span>To save himself for better fortune,                            60</span><br/>

<span>That he resolv'd, rather than yield,</span><br/>

<span>To die with honour in the field,</span><br/>

<span>And sell his hide and carcase at</span><br/>

<span>A price as high and desperate</span><br/>

<span>As e'er he could. This resolution                              65</span><br/>

<span>He forthwith put in execution,</span><br/>

<span>And bravely threw himself among</span><br/>

<span>The enemy i' th' greatest throng.</span><br/>

<span>But what cou'd single valour do</span><br/>

<span>Against so numerous a foe?                                     70</span><br/>

<span>Yet much he did indeed, too much</span><br/>

<span>To be believ'd, where th' odds were such.</span><br/>

<span>But one against a multitude</span><br/>

<span>Is more than mortal can make good.</span><br/>

<span>For while one party he oppos'd,                                75</span><br/>

<span>His rear was suddenly inclos'd;</span><br/>

<span>And no room left him for retreat,</span><br/>

<span>Or fight against a foe so great.</span><br/>

<span>For now the mastives, charging home,</span><br/>

<span>To blows and handy gripes were come:                           80</span><br/>

<span>While manfully himself he bore,</span><br/>

<span>And setting his right-foot before,</span><br/>

<span>He rais'd himself, to shew how tall</span><br/>

<span>His person was above them all.</span><br/>

<span>This equal shame and envy stirr'd                              85</span><br/>

<span>In th' enemy, that one should beard</span><br/>

<span>So many warriors, and so stout,</span><br/>

<span>As he had done, and stav'd it out,</span><br/>

<span>Disdaining to lay down his arms,</span><br/>

<span>And yield on honourable terms.                                 90</span><br/>

<span>Enraged thus, some in the rear</span><br/>

<span>Attack'd him, and some ev'ry where,</span><br/>

<span>Till down he fell; yet falling fought,</span><br/>

<span>And, being down, still laid about;</span><br/>

<span>As WIDDRINGTON, in doleful dumps,                              95</span><br/>

<span>Is said to light upon his stumps.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>But all, alas! had been in vain,</span><br/>

<span>And he inevitably slain,</span><br/>

<span>If TRULLA and CERDON, in the nick,</span><br/>

<span>To rescue him had not been quick;                             100</span><br/>

<span>For TRULLA, who was light of foot</span><br/>

<span>As shafts which long-field Parthians shoot,</span><br/>

<span>(But not so light as to be borne</span><br/>

<span>Upon the ears of standing corn,</span><br/>

<span>Or trip it o'er the water quicker                             105</span><br/>

<span>Than witches, when their staves they liquor,</span><br/>

<span>As some report,) was got among</span><br/>

<span>The foremost of the martial throng;</span><br/>

<span>There pitying the vanquish'd Bear,</span><br/>

<span>She call'd to CERDON, who stood near,                         110</span><br/>

<span>Viewing the bloody fight; to whom,</span><br/>

<span>Shall we (quoth she) stand still hum-drum,</span><br/>

<span>And see stout Bruin all alone,</span><br/>

<span>By numbers basely overthrown?</span><br/>

<span>Such feats already h' has atchiev'd,                          115</span><br/>

<span>In story not to be believ'd;</span><br/>

<span>And 'twould to us be shame enough,</span><br/>

<span>Not to attempt to fetch him off.</span><br/>

<span>I would (quoth he) venture a limb</span><br/>

<span>To second thee, and rescue him:                               120</span><br/>

<span>But then we must about it straight,</span><br/>

<span>Or else our aid will come too late.</span><br/>

<span>Quarter he scorns, he is so stout,</span><br/>

<span>And therefore cannot long hold out.</span><br/>

<span>This said, they wav'd their weapons round                     125</span><br/>

<span>About their heads, to clear the ground;</span><br/>

<span>And joining forces, laid about</span><br/>

<span>So fiercely, that th' amazed rout</span><br/>

<span>Turn'd tale again, and straight begun,</span><br/>

<span>As if the Devil drove, to run.                                130</span><br/>

<span>Meanwhile th' approach'd th' place where Bruin</span><br/>

<span>Was now engag'd to mortal ruin.</span><br/>

<span>The conqu'ring foe they soon assail'd;</span><br/>

<span>First TRULLA stav'd, and CERDON tail'd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-74" id="noteref-74" epub:type="noteref">74</a></span><br/>

<span>Until their mastives loos'd their hold:                       135</span><br/>

<span>And yet, alas! do what they could,</span><br/>

<span>The worsted Bear came off with store</span><br/>

<span>Of bloody wounds, but all before:</span><br/>

<span>For as ACHILLES, dipt in pond,</span><br/>

<span>Was ANABAPTIZ'D free from wound,                              140</span><br/>

<span>Made proof against dead-doing steel</span><br/>

<span>All over, but the Pagan heel;</span><br/>

<span>So did our champion's arms defend</span><br/>

<span>All of him, but the other end,</span><br/>

<span>His head and ears, which, in the martial                      145</span><br/>

<span>Encounter, lost a leathern parcel</span><br/>

<span>For as an Austrian Archduke once</span><br/>

<span>Had one ear (which in ducatoons</span><br/>

<span>Is half the coin) in battle par'd</span><br/>

<span>Close to his head, so Bruin far'd;                            150</span><br/>

<span>But tugg'd and pull'd on th' other side,</span><br/>

<span>Like scriv'ner newly crucify'd;</span><br/>

<span>Or like the late corrected leathern</span><br/>

<span>Ears of the Circumcised Brethren.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-75" id="noteref-75" epub:type="noteref">75</a></span><br/>

<span>But gentle TRULLA into th' ring                               155</span><br/>

<span>He wore in's nose convey'd a string,</span><br/>

<span>With which she march'd before, and led</span><br/>

<span>The warrior to a grassy bed,</span><br/>

<span>As authors write, in a cool shade,</span><br/>

<span>Which eglantine and roses made;                               160</span><br/>

<span>Close by a softly murm'ring stream,</span><br/>

<span>Where lovers us'd to loll and dream.</span><br/>

<span>There leaving him to his repose,</span><br/>

<span>Secured from pursuit of foes,</span><br/>

<span>And wanting nothing but a song,                               165</span><br/>

<span>And a well-tun'd theorbo hung</span><br/>

<span>Upon a bough, to ease the pain</span><br/>

<span>His tugg'd ears suffer'd, with a strain,</span><br/>

<span>They both drew up, to march in quest</span><br/>

<span>Of his great leader and the rest.                             170</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>For ORSIN (who was more renown'd</span><br/>

<span>For stout maintaining of his ground</span><br/>

<span>In standing fight, than for pursuit,</span><br/>

<span>As being not so quick of foot)</span><br/>

<span>Was not long able to keep pace                                175</span><br/>

<span>With others that pursu'd the chace;</span><br/>

<span>But found himself left far behind,</span><br/>

<span>Both out of heart and out of wind:</span><br/>

<span>Griev'd to behold his Bear pursu'd</span><br/>

<span>So basely by a multitude;                                     180</span><br/>

<span>And like to fall, not by the prowess,</span><br/>

<span>But numbers of his coward foes.</span><br/>

<span>He rag'd, and kept as heavy a coil as</span><br/>

<span>Stout HERCULES for loss of HYLAS;</span><br/>

<span>Forcing the vallies to repeat                                 185</span><br/>

<span>The accents of his sad regret.</span><br/>

<span>He beat his breast, and tore his hair,</span><br/>

<span>For loss of his dear Crony Bear;</span><br/>

<span>That Eccho, from the hollow ground,</span><br/>

<span>His doleful wailings did resound                              190</span><br/>

<span>More wistfully, by many times,</span><br/>

<span>Than in small poets splay-foot rhimes</span><br/>

<span>That make her, in their rueful stories</span><br/>

<span>To answer to int'rogatories,</span><br/>

<span>And most unconscionably depose                                195</span><br/>

<span>To things of which she nothing knows;</span><br/>

<span>And when she has said all she can say,</span><br/>

<span>'Tis wrested to the lover's fancy.</span><br/>

<span>Quoth he, O whither, wicked Bruin</span><br/>

<span>Art thou fled to my —  Eccho, Ruin?                          200</span><br/>

<span>I thought th' hadst scorn'd to budge a step</span><br/>

<span>For fear. (Quoth Eccho) Marry guep.</span><br/>

<span>Am not I here to take thy part?</span><br/>

<span>Then what has quelled thy stubborn heart?</span><br/>

<span>Have these bones rattled, and this head                       205</span><br/>

<span>So often in thy quarrel bled?</span><br/>

<span>Nor did I ever winch or grudge it,</span><br/>

<span>For thy dear sake. (Quoth she) Mum budget</span><br/>

<span>Think'st thou 'twill not be laid i' th' dish</span><br/>

<span>Thou turn'dst thy back? Quoth Eccho, Fish.                    210</span><br/>

<span>To run from those t'hast overcome</span><br/>

<span>Thus cowardly? Quoth Eccho, Mum.</span><br/>

<span>But what a vengeance makes thee fly</span><br/>

<span>From me too, as thine enemy?</span><br/>

<span>Or if thou hast no thought of me,                             215</span><br/>

<span>Nor what I have endur'd for thee,</span><br/>

<span>Yet shame and honour might prevail</span><br/>

<span>To keep thee thus from turning tail:</span><br/>

<span>For who would grudge to spend his blood in</span><br/>

<span>His honour's cause? Quoth she, A puddin.                      220</span><br/>

<span>This said, his grief to anger turn'd,</span><br/>

<span>Which in his manly stomach burn'd;</span><br/>

<span>Thirst of revenge, and wrath, in place</span><br/>

<span>Of sorrow, now began to blaze.</span><br/>

<span>He vow'd the authors of his woe                               225</span><br/>

<span>Should equal vengeance undergo;</span><br/>

<span>And with their bones and flesh pay dear</span><br/>

<span>For what he suffer'd, and his Bear.</span><br/>

<span>This b'ing resolv'd, with equal speed</span><br/>

<span>And rage he hasted to proceed                                 230</span><br/>

<span>To action straight, and giving o'er</span><br/>

<span>To search for Bruin any more,</span><br/>

<span>He went in quest of HUDIBRAS,</span><br/>

<span>To find him out where-e'er he was;</span><br/>

<span>And, if he were above ground, vow'd                           235</span><br/>

<span>He'd ferret him, lurk where be wou'd.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>But scarce had he a furlong on</span><br/>

<span>This resolute adventure gone,</span><br/>

<span>When he encounter'd with that crew</span><br/>

<span>Whom HUDIBRAS did late subdue.                                240</span><br/>

<span>Honour, revenge, contempt, and shame,</span><br/>

<span>Did equally their breasts inflame.</span><br/>

<span>'Mong these the fierce MAGNANO was,</span><br/>

<span>And TALGOL, foe to HUDIBRAS;</span><br/>

<span>CERDON and COLON, warriors stout,                             245</span><br/>

<span>As resolute, as ever fought;</span><br/>

<span>Whom furious ORSIN thus bespoke:</span><br/>

<span>Shall we (quoth be) thus basely brook</span><br/>

<span>The vile affront that paltry ass,</span><br/>

<span>And feeble scoundrel, HUDIBRAS,                               250</span><br/>

<span>With that more paltry ragamuffin,</span><br/>

<span>RALPHO, with vapouring and huffing,</span><br/>

<span>Have put upon us like tame cattle,</span><br/>

<span>As if th' had routed us in battle?</span><br/>

<span>For my part, it shall ne'er be said,                          255</span><br/>

<span>I for the washing gave my bead:</span><br/>

<span>Nor did I turn my back for fear</span><br/>

<span>O' th' rascals, but loss of my Bear,</span><br/>

<span>Which now I'm like to undergo;</span><br/>

<span>For whether those fell wounds, or no                          260</span><br/>

<span>He has receiv'd in fight, are mortal,</span><br/>

<span>Is more than all my skill can foretell</span><br/>

<span>Nor do I know what is become</span><br/>

<span>Of him, more than the Pope of Rome.</span><br/>

<span>But if I can but find them out                                265</span><br/>

<span>That caus'd it (as I shall, no doubt,</span><br/>

<span>Where-e'er th' in hugger-mugger lurk)</span><br/>

<span>I'll make them rue their handy-work;</span><br/>

<span>And wish that they had rather dar'd</span><br/>

<span>To pull the Devil by the beard.                               270</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth CERD0N, Noble ORSIN, th' hast</span><br/>

<span>Great reason to do as thou say'st,</span><br/>

<span>And so has ev'ry body here,</span><br/>

<span>As well as thou hast, or thy Bear.</span><br/>

<span>Others may do as they see good;                               275</span><br/>

<span>But if this twig be made of wood</span><br/>

<span>That will hold tack, I'll make the fur</span><br/>

<span>Fly 'bout the ears of that old cur;</span><br/>

<span>And the other mungrel vermin, RALPH,</span><br/>

<span>That brav'd us all in his behalf.                             280</span><br/>

<span>Thy Bear is safe, and out of peril,</span><br/>

<span>Though lugg'd indeed, and wounded very ill;</span><br/>

<span>Myself and TRULLA made a shift</span><br/>

<span>To help him out at a dead lift;</span><br/>

<span>And, having brought him bravely off,                          285</span><br/>

<span>Have left him where he's safe enough:</span><br/>

<span>There let him rest; for if we stay,</span><br/>

<span>The slaves may hap to get away.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>This said, they all engag'd to join</span><br/>

<span>Their forces in the same design;                              290</span><br/>

<span>And forthwith put themselves in search</span><br/>

<span>Of HUDIBRAS upon their march.</span><br/>

<span>Where leave we awhile, to tell</span><br/>

<span>What the victorious knight befel.</span><br/>

<span>For such, CROWDERO being fast                                 295</span><br/>

<span>In dungeon shut, we left him last.</span><br/>

<span>Triumphant laurels seem'd to grow</span><br/>

<span>No where so green as on his brow;</span><br/>

<span>Laden with which, as well as tir'd</span><br/>

<span>With conquering toil, he now retir'd                          300</span><br/>

<span>Unto a neighb'ring castle by,</span><br/>

<span>To rest his body, and apply</span><br/>

<span>Fit med'cines to each glorious bruise</span><br/>

<span>He got in fight, reds, blacks, and blues,</span><br/>

<span>To mollify th' uneasy pang                                    305</span><br/>

<span>Of ev'ry honourable bang,</span><br/>

<span>Which b'ing by skilful midwife drest,</span><br/>

<span>He laid him down to take his rest.</span><br/>

<span>But all in vain. H' had got a hurt</span><br/>

<span>O' th' inside, of a deadlier sort,                            310</span><br/>

<span>By CUPID made, who took his stand</span><br/>

<span>Upon a Widow's jointure land,</span><br/>

<span>(For he, in all his am'rous battels,</span><br/>

<span>No 'dvantage finds like goods and chattels,)</span><br/>

<span>Drew home his bow, and, aiming right,                         315</span><br/>

<span>Let fly an arrow at the Knight:</span><br/>

<span>The shaft against a rib did glance,</span><br/>

<span>And gall'd him in the purtenance.</span><br/>

<span>But time had somewhat 'swag'd his pain,</span><br/>

<span>After he found his suit in vain.                              320</span><br/>

<span>For that proud dame, for whom his soul</span><br/>

<span>Was burnt in's belly like a coal,</span><br/>

<span>(That belly which so oft did ake</span><br/>

<span>And suffer griping for her sake,</span><br/>

<span>Till purging comfits and ants-eggs                            325</span><br/>

<span>Had almost brought him off his legs,)</span><br/>

<span>Us'd him so like a base rascallion,</span><br/>

<span>That old Pyg — (what d'y' call him) malion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-76" id="noteref-76" epub:type="noteref">76</a></span><br/>

<span>That cut his mistress out of stone,</span><br/>

<span>Had not so hard a-hearted one.                                330</span><br/>

<span>She had a thousand jadish tricks,</span><br/>

<span>Worse than a mule that flings and kicks;</span><br/>

<span>'Mong which one cross-grain'd freak she had,</span><br/>

<span>As insolent as strange and mad;</span><br/>

<span>She could love none, but only such                            335</span><br/>

<span>As scorn'd and hated her as much.</span><br/>

<span>'Twas a strange riddle of a lady:</span><br/>

<span>Not love, if any lov'd her! Hey dey!</span><br/>

<span>So cowards never use their might,</span><br/>

<span>But against such as will not fight;                           340</span><br/>

<span>So some diseases have been found</span><br/>

<span>Only to seize upon the sound.</span><br/>

<span>He that gets her by heart, must say her</span><br/>

<span>The back way, like a witch's prayer.</span><br/>

<span>Mean while the Knight had no small task                       345</span><br/>

<span>To compass what he durst not ask.</span><br/>

<span>He loves, but dares not make the motion;</span><br/>

<span>Her ignorance is his devotion:</span><br/>

<span>Like caitiff vile, that, for misdeed,</span><br/>

<span>Rides with his face to rump of steed,                         350</span><br/>

<span>Or rowing scull, he's fain to love,</span><br/>

<span>Look one way, and another move;</span><br/>

<span>Or like a tumbler, that does play</span><br/>

<span>His game, and look another way,</span><br/>

<span>Until he seize upon the cony;                                 355</span><br/>

<span>Just so he does by matrimony:</span><br/>

<span>But all in vain; her subtle snout</span><br/>

<span>Did quickly wind his meaning out;</span><br/>

<span>Which she return'd with too much scorn</span><br/>

<span>To be by man of honour borne:                                 360</span><br/>

<span>Yet much he bore, until the distress</span><br/>

<span>He suffer'd from his spightful mistress</span><br/>

<span>Did stir his stomach; and the pain</span><br/>

<span>He had endur'd from her disdain,</span><br/>

<span>Turn'd to regret so resolute,                                 365</span><br/>

<span>That he resolv'd to wave his suit,</span><br/>

<span>And either to renounce her quite,</span><br/>

<span>Or for a while play least in sight.</span><br/>

<span>This resolution b'ing put on,</span><br/>

<span>He kept some months, and more had done;                       370</span><br/>

<span>But being brought so nigh by Fate,</span><br/>

<span>The victory he atchiev'd so late</span><br/>

<span>Did set his thoughts agog, and ope</span><br/>

<span>A door to discontinu'd hope,</span><br/>

<span>That seem'd to promise he might win                           375</span><br/>

<span>His dame too, now his hand was in;</span><br/>

<span>And that his valour, and the honour</span><br/>

<span>H' had newly gain'd, might work upon her.</span><br/>

<span>These reasons made his mouth to water</span><br/>

<span>With am'rous longings to be at her.                           380</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth he, unto himself, Who knows,</span><br/>

<span>But this brave conquest o'er my foes</span><br/>

<span>May reach her heart, and make that stoop,</span><br/>

<span>As I but now have forc'd the troop?</span><br/>

<span>If nothing can oppugn love,                                   385</span><br/>

<span>And virtue invious ways can prove,</span><br/>

<span>What may he not confide to do</span><br/>

<span>That brings both love and virtue too?</span><br/>

<span>But thou bring'st valour too and wit;</span><br/>

<span>Two things that seldom fail to hit.                           390</span><br/>

<span>Valour's a mouse-trap, wit a gin,</span><br/>

<span>Which women oft are taken in.</span><br/>

<span>Then, HUDIBRAS, why should'st thou fear</span><br/>

<span>To be, that art a conqueror?</span><br/>

<span>Fortune th' audacious doth juvare,                            395</span><br/>

<span>But lets the timidous miscarry.</span><br/>

<span>Then while the honour thou hast got</span><br/>

<span>Is spick and span new, piping hot,</span><br/>

<span>Strike her up bravely, thou hadst best,</span><br/>

<span>And trust thy fortune with the rest.                          400</span><br/>

<span>Such thoughts as these the Knight did keep,</span><br/>

<span>More than his bangs or fleas, from sleep.</span><br/>

<span>And as an owl, that in a barn</span><br/>

<span>Sees a mouse creeping in the corn,</span><br/>

<span>Sits still, and shuts his round blue eyes,                    405</span><br/>

<span>As if he slept, until he spies</span><br/>

<span>The little beast within his reach,</span><br/>

<span>Then starts, and seizes on the wretch;</span><br/>

<span>So from his couch the Knight did start</span><br/>

<span>To seize upon the widow's heart;                              410</span><br/>

<span>Crying with hasty tone, and hoarse,</span><br/>

<span>RALPHO, dispatch; To Horse, To Horse.</span><br/>

<span>And 'twas but time; for now the rout,</span><br/>

<span>We left engag'd to seek him out,</span><br/>

<span>By speedy marches, were advanc'd                              415</span><br/>

<span>Up to the fort, where he ensconc'd;</span><br/>

<span>And all th' avenues had possest</span><br/>

<span>About the place, from east to west.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>That done, a while they made a halt,</span><br/>

<span>To view the ground, and where t' assault:                     420</span><br/>

<span>Then call'd a council, which was best,</span><br/>

<span>By siege or onslaught, to invest</span><br/>

<span>The enemy; and 'twas agreed,</span><br/>

<span>By storm and onslaught to proceed.</span><br/>

<span>This b'ing resolv'd, in comely sort                           425</span><br/>

<span>They now drew up t' attack the fort;</span><br/>

<span>When HUDIBRAS, about to enter</span><br/>

<span>Upon another-gates adventure,</span><br/>

<span>To RALPHO call'd aloud to arm,</span><br/>

<span>Not dreaming of approaching storm.                            430</span><br/>

<span>Whether Dame Fortune, or the care</span><br/>

<span>Of Angel bad or tutelar,</span><br/>

<span>Did arm, or thrust him on a danger</span><br/>

<span>To which he was an utter stranger;</span><br/>

<span>That foresight might, or might not, blot                      435</span><br/>

<span>The glory he had newly got;</span><br/>

<span>For to his shame it might be said,</span><br/>

<span>They took him napping in his bed;</span><br/>

<span>To them we leave it to expound,</span><br/>

<span>That deal in sciences profound.                               440</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>His courser scarce he had bestrid,</span><br/>

<span>And RALPHO that on which he rid,</span><br/>

<span>When setting ope the postern gate,</span><br/>

<span>Which they thought best to sally at,</span><br/>

<span>The foe appear'd, drawn up and drill'd,                       445</span><br/>

<span>Ready to charge them in the field.</span><br/>

<span>This somewhat startled the bold Knight,</span><br/>

<span>Surpriz'd with th' unexpected sight.</span><br/>

<span>The bruises of his bones and flesh</span><br/>

<span>The thought began to smart afresh;                            450</span><br/>

<span>Till recollecting wonted courage,</span><br/>

<span>His fear was soon converted to rage,</span><br/>

<span>And thus he spoke: The coward foe,</span><br/>

<span>Whom we but now gave quarter to,</span><br/>

<span>Look, yonder's rally'd, and appears                           455</span><br/>

<span>As if they had out-run their fears.</span><br/>

<span>The glory we did lately get,</span><br/>

<span>The Fates command us to repeat;</span><br/>

<span>And to their wills we must succumb,</span><br/>

<span>Quocunque trahunt, 'tis our doom.                             460</span><br/>

<span>This is the same numeric crew</span><br/>

<span>Which we so lately did subdue;</span><br/>

<span>The self-same individuals that</span><br/>

<span>Did run as mice do from a cat,</span><br/>

<span>When we courageously did wield                                465</span><br/>

<span>Our martial weapons in the field</span><br/>

<span>To tug for victory; and when</span><br/>

<span>We shall our shining blades agen</span><br/>

<span>Brandish in terror o'er our heads,</span><br/>

<span>They'll straight resume their wonted dreads.                  470</span><br/>

<span>Fear is an ague, that forsakes</span><br/>

<span>And haunts by fits those whom it takes:</span><br/>

<span>And they'll opine they feel the pain</span><br/>

<span>And blows they felt to-day again.</span><br/>

<span>Then let us boldly charge them home,                          475</span><br/>

<span>And make no doubt to overcome.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>This said, his courage to inflame,</span><br/>

<span>He call'd upon his mistress' name.</span><br/>

<span>His pistol next he cock'd a-new,</span><br/>

<span>And out his nut-brown whinyard drew;                          480</span><br/>

<span>And, placing RALPHO in the front,</span><br/>

<span>Reserv'd himself to bear the brunt,</span><br/>

<span>As expert warriors use: then ply'd</span><br/>

<span>With iron heel his courser's side,</span><br/>

<span>Conveying sympathetic speed                                   485</span><br/>

<span>From heel of Knight to heel of Steed.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Mean while the foe, with equal rage</span><br/>

<span>And speed, advancing to engage,</span><br/>

<span>Both parties now were drawn so close,</span><br/>

<span>Almost to come to handy-blows;                                490</span><br/>

<span>When ORSIN first let fly a stone</span><br/>

<span>At RALPHO: not so huge a one</span><br/>

<span>As that which DIOMED did maul</span><br/>

<span>AENEAS on the bum withal</span><br/>

<span>Yet big enough if rightly hurl'd,                             495</span><br/>

<span>T' have sent him to another world,</span><br/>

<span>Whether above-ground, or below,</span><br/>

<span>Which Saints Twice Dipt are destin'd to.</span><br/>

<span>The danger startled the bold Squire,</span><br/>

<span>And made him some few steps retire.                           500</span><br/>

<span>But HUDIBRAS advanc'd to's aid,</span><br/>

<span>And rouz'd his spirits, half dismay'd.</span><br/>

<span>He wisely doubting lest the shot</span><br/>

<span>Of th' enemy, now growing hot,</span><br/>

<span>Might at a distance gall, press'd close,                      505</span><br/>

<span>To come pell-mell to handy-blows,</span><br/>

<span>And, that he might their aim decline,</span><br/>

<span>Advanc'd still in an oblique line;</span><br/>

<span>But prudently forbore to fire,</span><br/>

<span>Till breast to breast he had got nigher,                      510</span><br/>

<span>As expert warriors use to do</span><br/>

<span>When hand to hand they charge their foe.</span><br/>

<span>This order the advent'rous Knight,</span><br/>

<span>Most soldier-like, observ'd in fight,</span><br/>

<span>When fortune (as she's wont) turn'd fickle,                   515</span><br/>

<span>And for the foe began to stickle.</span><br/>

<span>The more shame for her Goody-ship,</span><br/>

<span>To give so near a friend the slip.</span><br/>

<span>For COLON, choosing out a stone,</span><br/>

<span>Levell'd so right, it thump'd upon                            520</span><br/>

<span>His manly paunch with such a force,</span><br/>

<span>As almost beat him off his horse.</span><br/>

<span>He lost his whinyard, and the rein;</span><br/>

<span>But, laying fast hold of the mane,</span><br/>

<span>Preserv'd his seat; and as a goose                            525</span><br/>

<span>In death contracts his talons close,</span><br/>

<span>So did the Knight, and with one claw</span><br/>

<span>The trigger of his pistol draw.</span><br/>

<span>The gun went off: and as it was</span><br/>

<span>Still fatal to stout HUDIBRAS,                                530</span><br/>

<span>In all his feats of arms, when least</span><br/>

<span>He dreamt of it, to prosper best,</span><br/>

<span>So now he far'd: the shot, let fly</span><br/>

<span>At random 'mong the enemy,</span><br/>

<span>Pierc'd TALGOL's gaberdine, and grazing                       535</span><br/>

<span>Upon his shoulder, in the passing,</span><br/>

<span>Lodg'd in MAGNANO's brass habergeon,</span><br/>

<span>Who straight, A Surgeon, cry'd, A Surgeon.</span><br/>

<span>He tumbled down, and, as he fell,</span><br/>

<span>Did Murther, Murther, Murther, yell.                          540</span><br/>

<span>This startled their whole body so,</span><br/>

<span>That if the Knight had not let go</span><br/>

<span>His arms, but been in warlike plight,</span><br/>

<span>H' had won (the second time) the fight;</span><br/>

<span>As, if the Squire had but fall'n on,                          545</span><br/>

<span>He had inevitably done:</span><br/>

<span>But he, diverted with the care</span><br/>

<span>Or HUDIBRAS his hurt, forbare</span><br/>

<span>To press th' advantage of his fortune</span><br/>

<span>While danger did the rest dishearten:                         550</span><br/>

<span>For he with CERDON b'ing engag'd</span><br/>

<span>In close encounter, they both wag'd</span><br/>

<span>The fight so well, 'twas hard to say</span><br/>

<span>Which side was like to get the day.</span><br/>

<span>And now the busy work of death                                555</span><br/>

<span>Had tir'd them so, th' agreed to breath,</span><br/>

<span>Preparing to renew the fight,</span><br/>

<span>When the disaster of the Knight,</span><br/>

<span>And th' other party, did divert</span><br/>

<span>Their fell intent, and forc'd them part.                      560</span><br/>

<span>RALPHO press'd up to HUDIBRAS,</span><br/>

<span>And CERDON where MAGNANO was;</span><br/>

<span>Each striving to confirm his party</span><br/>

<span>With stout encouragements, and hearty.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth RALIHO, Courage, valiant Sir,                           565</span><br/>

<span>And let revenge and honour stir</span><br/>

<span>Your spirits up: once we fall on,</span><br/>

<span>The shatter'd foe begins to run:</span><br/>

<span>For if but half so well you knew</span><br/>

<span>To use your victory as subdue,                                570</span><br/>

<span>They durst not, after such a blow</span><br/>

<span>As you have given them, face us now;</span><br/>

<span>But from so formidable a soldier</span><br/>

<span>Had fled like crows when they smell powder.</span><br/>

<span>Thrice have they seen your sword aloft                        575</span><br/>

<span>Wav'd o'er their heads, and fled as oft.</span><br/>

<span>But if you let them recollect</span><br/>

<span>Their spirits, now dismay'd and checkt,</span><br/>

<span>You'll have a harder game to play</span><br/>

<span>Than yet y' have had to get the day.                          580</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Thus spoke the stout Squire; but was heard</span><br/>

<span>By HUDIBRAS with small regard.</span><br/>

<span>His thoughts were fuller of the bang</span><br/>

<span>Be lately took than RALPH'S harangue;</span><br/>

<span>To which he answer'd, Cruel Fate                              585</span><br/>

<span>Tells me thy counsel comes too late.</span><br/>

<span>The knotted blood within my hose,</span><br/>

<span>That from my wounded body flows,</span><br/>

<span>With mortal crisis doth portend</span><br/>

<span>My days to appropinque an end.                                590</span><br/>

<span>I am for action now unfit,</span><br/>

<span>Either of fortitude or wit:</span><br/>

<span>Fortune, my foe, begins to frown,</span><br/>

<span>Resolv'd to pull my stomach down.</span><br/>

<span>I am not apt, upon a wound,                                   595</span><br/>

<span>Or trivial basting, to despond:</span><br/>

<span>Yet I'd be loth my days to curtail:</span><br/>

<span>For if I thought my wounds not mortal,</span><br/>

<span>Or that we'd time enough as yet,</span><br/>

<span>To make an hon'rable retreat,                                 600</span><br/>

<span>'Twere the best course: but if they find</span><br/>

<span>We fly, and leave our arms behind</span><br/>

<span>For them to seize on, the dishonour,</span><br/>

<span>And danger too, is such, I'll sooner</span><br/>

<span>Stand to it boldly, and take quarter,                         605</span><br/>

<span>To let them see I am no starter.</span><br/>

<span>In all the trade of war, no feat</span><br/>

<span>Is nobler than a brave retreat:</span><br/>

<span>For those that run away, and fly,</span><br/>

<span>Take place at least of th' enemy.                             610</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>This said, the Squire, with active speed</span><br/>

<span>Dismounted from his bonny steed,</span><br/>

<span>To seize the arms, which, by mischance,</span><br/>

<span>Fell from the bold Knight in a trance.</span><br/>

<span>These being found out, and restor'd                           615</span><br/>

<span>To HUDIBRAS their natural lord,</span><br/>

<span>As a man may say, with might and main,</span><br/>

<span>He hasted to get up again.</span><br/>

<span>Thrice he assay'd to mount aloft,</span><br/>

<span>But, by his weighty bum, as oft                               620</span><br/>

<span>He was pull'd back, till having found</span><br/>

<span>Th' advantage of the rising ground,</span><br/>

<span>Thither he led his warlike steed,</span><br/>

<span>And having plac'd him right, with speed</span><br/>

<span>Prepar'd again to scale the beast,                            625</span><br/>

<span>When ORSIN, who had newly drest</span><br/>

<span>The bloody scar upon the shoulder</span><br/>

<span>Of TALGOL with Promethean powder,</span><br/>

<span>And now was searching for the shot</span><br/>

<span>That laid MAGNANO on the spot,                                630</span><br/>

<span>Beheld the sturdy Squire aforesaid</span><br/>

<span>Preparing to climb up his horse side.</span><br/>

<span>He left his cure, and laying hold</span><br/>

<span>Upon his arms, with courage bold,</span><br/>

<span>Cry'd out, 'Tis now no time to dally,                         635</span><br/>

<span>The enemy begin to rally:</span><br/>

<span>Let us, that are unhurt and whole,</span><br/>

<span>Fall on, and happy man be's dole.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>This said, like to a thunderbolt,</span><br/>

<span>He flew with fury to th' assault,                             640</span><br/>

<span>Striving the enemy to attack</span><br/>

<span>Before he reach'd his horse's back.</span><br/>

<span>RALPHO was mounted now, and gotten</span><br/>

<span>O'erthwart his beast with active vau'ting,</span><br/>

<span>Wrigling his body to recover                                  645</span><br/>

<span>His seat, and cast his right leg over,</span><br/>

<span>When ORSIN, rushing in, bestow'd</span><br/>

<span>On horse and man so heavy a load,</span><br/>

<span>The beast was startled, and begun</span><br/>

<span>To kick and fling like mad, and run,                          650</span><br/>

<span>Bearing the tough Squire like a sack,</span><br/>

<span>Or stout king RICHARD, on his back,</span><br/>

<span>'Till stumbling, he threw him down,</span><br/>

<span>Sore bruis'd, and cast into a swoon.</span><br/>

<span>Meanwhile the Knight began to rouze                           655</span><br/>

<span>The sparkles of his wonted prowess.</span><br/>

<span>He thrust his hand into his hose,</span><br/>

<span>And found, both by his eyes and nose,</span><br/>

<span>'Twas only choler, and not blood,</span><br/>

<span>That from his wounded body flow'd.                            660</span><br/>

<span>This, with the hazard of the Squire,</span><br/>

<span>Inflam'd him with despightful ire.</span><br/>

<span>Courageously he fac'd about.</span><br/>

<span>And drew his other pistol out,</span><br/>

<span>And now had half way bent the cock,                           665</span><br/>

<span>When CERDON gave so fierce a shock,</span><br/>

<span>With sturdy truncheon, thwart his arm,</span><br/>

<span>That down it fell, and did no harm;</span><br/>

<span>Then stoutly pressing on with speed,</span><br/>

<span>Assay'd to pull him off his steed.                            670</span><br/>

<span>The Knight his sword had only left,</span><br/>

<span>With which he CERDON'S head had cleft,</span><br/>

<span>Or at the least cropt off a limb,</span><br/>

<span>But ORSIN came, and rescu'd him.</span><br/>

<span>He, with his lance, attack'd the Knight                       675</span><br/>

<span>Upon his quarters opposite.</span><br/>

<span>But as a barque, that in foul weather,</span><br/>

<span>Toss'd by two adverse winds together,</span><br/>

<span>Is bruis'd, and beaten to and fro,</span><br/>

<span>And knows not which to turn him to;                           680</span><br/>

<span>So far'd the Knight between two foes,</span><br/>

<span>And knew not which of them t'oppose;</span><br/>

<span>Till ORSIN, charging with his lance</span><br/>

<span>At HUDIBRAS, by spightful chance,</span><br/>

<span>Hit CERDON such a bang, as stunn'd                            685</span><br/>

<span>And laid him flat upon the ground.</span><br/>

<span>At this the Knight began to chear up,</span><br/>

<span>And, raising up himself on stirrup,</span><br/>

<span>Cry'd out, Victoria! Lie thou there,</span><br/>

<span>And I shall straight dispatch another,                        690</span><br/>

<span>To bear thee company in death:</span><br/>

<span>But first I'll halt a while, and breath:</span><br/>

<span>As well he might; for ORSIN, griev'd</span><br/>

<span>At th' wound that CERDON had receiv'd,</span><br/>

<span>Ran to relieve him with his lore,                             695</span><br/>

<span>And cure the hurt he gave before.</span><br/>

<span>Mean while the Knight had wheel'd about,</span><br/>

<span>To breathe himself, and next find out</span><br/>

<span>Th' advantage of the ground, where best</span><br/>

<span>He might the ruffled foe infest.                              700</span><br/>

<span>This b'ing resolv'd, he spurr'd his steed,</span><br/>

<span>To run at ORSIN with full speed,</span><br/>

<span>While he was busy in the care</span><br/>

<span>Of CERDON'S wound, and unaware:</span><br/>

<span>But he was quick, and had already                             705</span><br/>

<span>Unto the part apply'd remedy:</span><br/>

<span>And, seeing th' enemy prepar'd,</span><br/>

<span>Drew up, and stood upon his guard.</span><br/>

<span>Then, like a warrior right expert</span><br/>

<span>And skilful in the martial art,                               710</span><br/>

<span>The subtle Knight straight made a halt,</span><br/>

<span>And judg'd it best to stay th' assault,</span><br/>

<span>Until he had reliev'd the Squire,</span><br/>

<span>And then in order to retire;</span><br/>

<span>Or, as occasion should invite,                                715</span><br/>

<span>With forces join'd renew the fight.</span><br/>

<span>RALPHO, by this time disentranc'd,</span><br/>

<span>Upon his bum himself advanc'd,</span><br/>

<span>Though sorely bruis'd; his limbs all o'er</span><br/>

<span>With ruthless bangs were stiff and sore.                      720</span><br/>

<span>Right fain he would have got upon</span><br/>

<span>His feet again, to get him gone;</span><br/>

<span>When HUDIBRAS to aid him came:</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth he (and call'd him by his name,)</span><br/>

<span>Courage! the day at length is ours;                           725</span><br/>

<span>And we once more, as conquerors,</span><br/>

<span>Have both the field and honour won:</span><br/>

<span>The foe is profligate, and run.</span><br/>

<span>I mean all such as can; for some</span><br/>

<span>This hand hath sent to their long home;                       730</span><br/>

<span>And some lie sprawling on the ground,</span><br/>

<span>With many a gash and bloody wound.</span><br/>

<span>CAESAR himself could never say</span><br/>

<span>He got two victories in a day,</span><br/>

<span>As I have done, that can say, Twice I                         735</span><br/>

<span>In one day, Veni, Vidi, Vici.</span><br/>

<span>The foe's so numerous, that we</span><br/>

<span>Cannot so often vincere</span><br/>

<span>As they perire, and yet enow</span><br/>

<span>Be left to strike an after-blow;                              740</span><br/>

<span>Then, lest they rally, and once more</span><br/>

<span>Put us to fight the bus'ness o'er,</span><br/>

<span>Get up, and mount thy steed: Dispatch,</span><br/>

<span>And let us both their motions watch.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth RALPH, I should not, if I were                          745</span><br/>

<span>In case for action, now be here:</span><br/>

<span>Nor have I turn'd my back, or hang'd</span><br/>

<span>An arse, for fear of being bang'd.</span><br/>

<span>It was for you I got these harms,</span><br/>

<span>Advent'ring to fetch off your arms.                           750</span><br/>

<span>The blows and drubs I have receiv'd</span><br/>

<span>Have bruis'd my body, and bereav'd</span><br/>

<span>My limbs of strength. Unless you stoop,</span><br/>

<span>And reach your hand to pull me up,</span><br/>

<span>I shall lie here, and be a prey                               755</span><br/>

<span>To those who now are run away.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>That thou shalt not, (quoth HUDIBRAS;)</span><br/>

<span>We read, the ancients held it was</span><br/>

<span>More honourable far, servare</span><br/>

<span>Civem, than slay an adversary:                                760</span><br/>

<span>The one we oft to-day have done,</span><br/>

<span>The other shall dispatch anon:</span><br/>

<span>And though th' art of a diff'rent Church</span><br/>

<span>I will not leave thee in the lurch.</span><br/>

<span>This said, he jogg'd his good steed nigher,                   765</span><br/>

<span>And steer'd him gently toward the Squire;</span><br/>

<span>Then bowing down his body, stretch'd</span><br/>

<span>His hand out, and at RALPHO reach'd;</span><br/>

<span>When TRULLA, whom he did not mind,</span><br/>

<span>Charg'd him like lightening behind.                           770</span><br/>

<span>She had been long in search about</span><br/>

<span>MAGNANO'S wound, to find it out;</span><br/>

<span>But could find none, nor where the shot,</span><br/>

<span>That had so startled him, was got</span><br/>

<span>But having found the worst was past,                          775</span><br/>

<span>She fell to her own work at last,</span><br/>

<span>The pillage of the prisoners,</span><br/>

<span>Which in all feats of arms was hers;</span><br/>

<span>And now to plunder RALPH she flew,</span><br/>

<span>When HUDIBRAS his hard fate drew                              780</span><br/>

<span>To succour him; for, as he bow'd</span><br/>

<span>To help him up, she laid a load</span><br/>

<span>Of blows so heavy, and plac'd so well,</span><br/>

<span>On t'other side, that down he fell.</span><br/>

<span>Yield, scoundrel base, (quoth she,) or die:                   785</span><br/>

<span>Thy life is mine and liberty:</span><br/>

<span>But if thou think'st I took thee tardy,</span><br/>

<span>And dar'st presume to be so hardy,</span><br/>

<span>To try thy fortune o'er a-fresh,</span><br/>

<span>I'll wave my title to thy flesh,                              790</span><br/>

<span>Thy arms and baggage, now my right;</span><br/>

<span>And if thou hast the heart to try't,</span><br/>

<span>I'll lend thee back thyself a while,</span><br/>

<span>And once more, for that carcass vile,</span><br/>

<span>Fight upon tick. — Quoth HUDIBRAS,                           795</span><br/>

<span>Thou offer'st nobly, valiant lass,</span><br/>

<span>And I shall take thee at thy word.</span><br/>

<span>First let me rise and take my sword.</span><br/>

<span>That sword which has so oft this day</span><br/>

<span>Through squadrons of my foes made way,                        800</span><br/>

<span>And some to other worlds dispatch'd,</span><br/>

<span>Now with a feeble spinster match'd,</span><br/>

<span>Will blush with blood ignoble stain'd,</span><br/>

<span>By which no honour's to be gain'd.</span><br/>

<span>But if thou'lt take m' advice in this,                        805</span><br/>

<span>Consider whilst thou may'st, what 'tis</span><br/>

<span>To interrupt a victor's course,</span><br/>

<span>B' opposing such a trivial force:</span><br/>

<span>For if with conquest I come off,</span><br/>

<span>(And that I shall do sure enough,)                            810</span><br/>

<span>Quarter thou canst not have, nor grace,</span><br/>

<span>By law of arms, in such a case;</span><br/>

<span>Both which I now do offer freely.</span><br/>

<span>I scorn (quoth she) thou coxcomb silly,</span><br/>

<span>(Clapping her hand upon her breech,                           815</span><br/>

<span>To shew how much she priz'd his speech,)</span><br/>

<span>Quarter or counsel from a foe</span><br/>

<span>If thou can'st force me to it, do.</span><br/>

<span>But lest it should again be said,</span><br/>

<span>When I have once more won thy head,                           820</span><br/>

<span>I took thee napping, unprepar'd,</span><br/>

<span>Arm, and betake thee to thy guard.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>This said, she to her tackle fell,</span><br/>

<span>And on the Knight let fall a peal</span><br/>

<span>Of blows so fierce, and press'd so home,                      825</span><br/>

<span>That he retir'd, and follow'd's bum.</span><br/>

<span>Stand to't (quoth she) or yield to mercy</span><br/>

<span>It is not fighting arsie-versie</span><br/>

<span>Shall serve thy turn. — This stirr'd his spleen</span><br/>

<span>More than the danger he was in,                               830</span><br/>

<span>The blows he felt, or was to feel,</span><br/>

<span>Although th' already made him reel.</span><br/>

<span>Honour, despight; revenge and shame,</span><br/>

<span>At once into his stomach came,</span><br/>

<span>Which fir'd it so, he rais'd his arm                          835</span><br/>

<span>Above his head, and rain'd a storm</span><br/>

<span>Of blows so terrible and thick,</span><br/>

<span>As if he meant to hash her quick.</span><br/>

<span>But she upon her truncheon took them,</span><br/>

<span>And by oblique diversion broke them,                          840</span><br/>

<span>Waiting an opportunity</span><br/>

<span>To pay all back with usury;</span><br/>

<span>Which long she fail'd not of; for now</span><br/>

<span>The Knight with one dead-doing blow</span><br/>

<span>Resolving to decide the fight,                                845</span><br/>

<span>And she, with quick and cunning slight,</span><br/>

<span>Avoiding it, the force and weight</span><br/>

<span>He charged upon it was so great,</span><br/>

<span>As almost sway'd him to the ground.</span><br/>

<span>No sooner she th' advantage found,                            850</span><br/>

<span>But in she flew; and seconding</span><br/>

<span>With home-made thrust the heavy swing,</span><br/>

<span>She laid him flat upon his side;</span><br/>

<span>And mounting on his trunk a-stride,</span><br/>

<span>Quoth she, I told thee what would come                        855</span><br/>

<span>Of all thy vapouring, base scum.</span><br/>

<span>Say, will the law of arms allow</span><br/>

<span>I may have grace and quarter now?</span><br/>

<span>Or wilt thou rather break thy word,</span><br/>

<span>And stain thine honour than thy sword?                        860</span><br/>

<span>A man of war to damn his soul,</span><br/>

<span>In basely breaking his parole</span><br/>

<span>And when, before the fight, th' had'st vow'd</span><br/>

<span>To give no quarter in cold blood</span><br/>

<span>Now thou hast got me for a Tartar,                            865</span><br/>

<span>To make me 'gainst my will take quarter;</span><br/>

<span>Why dost not put me to the sword,</span><br/>

<span>But cowardly fly from thy word?</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth HUDIBRAS, The day's thine own:</span><br/>

<span>Thou and thy Stars have cast me down:                         870</span><br/>

<span>My laurels are transplanted now,</span><br/>

<span>And flourish on thy conqu'ring brow:</span><br/>

<span>My loss of honour's great enough,</span><br/>

<span>Thou need'st not brand it with a scoff:</span><br/>

<span>Sarcasms may eclipse thine own,                               875</span><br/>

<span>But cannot blur my lost renown.</span><br/>

<span>I am not now in Fortune's power;</span><br/>

<span>He that is down can fall no lower.</span><br/>

<span>The ancient heroes were illustrious</span><br/>

<span>For being benign, and not blustrous,                          880</span><br/>

<span>Against a vanquish'd foe: their swords</span><br/>

<span>Were sharp and trenchant, not their words;</span><br/>

<span>And did in fight but cut work out</span><br/>

<span>To employ their courtesies about.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth she, Although thou hast deserv'd                        885</span><br/>

<span>Base slubberdegullion, to be serv'd</span><br/>

<span>As thou did'st vow to deal with me,</span><br/>

<span>If thou had'st got the victory</span><br/>

<span>Yet I shall rather act a part</span><br/>

<span>That suits my fame than thy desert.                           890</span><br/>

<span>Thy arms, thy liberty, beside</span><br/>

<span>All that's on th' outside of thy hide,</span><br/>

<span>Are mine by military law,</span><br/>

<span>Of which I will not hate one straw:</span><br/>

<span>The rest, thy life and limbs, once more,                      895</span><br/>

<span>Though doubly forfeit, I restore,</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth HUDIBRAS, It is too late</span><br/>

<span>For me to treat or stipulate</span><br/>

<span>What thou command'st, I must obey:</span><br/>

<span>Yet those whom I expugn'd to-day                              900</span><br/>

<span>Of thine own party, I let go,</span><br/>

<span>And gave them life and freedom too:</span><br/>

<span>Both dogs and bear, upon their parole,</span><br/>

<span>Whom I took pris'ners in this quarrel.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth TRULLA, Whether thou or they                            905</span><br/>

<span>Let one another run away,</span><br/>

<span>Concerns not me; but was't not thou</span><br/>

<span>That gave CROWDERO quarter too?</span><br/>

<span>CROWDERO, whom, in irons bound,</span><br/>

<span>Thou basely threw'st into LOB'S Pound,                        910</span><br/>

<span>Where still he lies, and with regret</span><br/>

<span>His gen'rous bowels rage and fret.</span><br/>

<span>But now thy carcass shall redeem,</span><br/>

<span>And serve to be exchang'd for him.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>This said, the Knight did straight submit,                    915</span><br/>

<span>And laid his weapons at her feet.</span><br/>

<span>Next he disrob'd his gaberdine,</span><br/>

<span>And with it did himself resign.</span><br/>

<span>She took it, and forthwith divesting</span><br/>

<span>The mantle that she wore, said jesting,                       920</span><br/>

<span>Take that, and wear it for my sake</span><br/>

<span>Then threw it o'er his sturdy back,</span><br/>

<span>And as the FRENCH, we conquer'd once,</span><br/>

<span>Now give us laws for pantaloons,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-77" id="noteref-77" epub:type="noteref">77</a></span><br/>

<span>The length of breeches, and the gathers,                      925</span><br/>

<span>Port-cannons, perriwigs, and feathers;</span><br/>

<span>Just so the proud insulting lass</span><br/>

<span>Array'd and dighted HUDIBRAS.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Meanwhile the other champions, yerst</span><br/>

<span>In hurry of the fight disperst,                               930</span><br/>

<span>Arriv'd, when TRULLA won the day,</span><br/>

<span>To share in th' honour and the prey,</span><br/>

<span>And out of HUDIBRAS his hide</span><br/>

<span>With vengeance to be satisfy'd;</span><br/>

<span>Which now they were about to pour                             935</span><br/>

<span>Upon him in a wooden show'r;</span><br/>

<span>But TRULLA thrust herself between,</span><br/>

<span>And striding o'er his back agen,</span><br/>

<span>She brandish'd o'er her head his sword,</span><br/>

<span>And vow'd they should not break her word;                     940</span><br/>

<span>Sh' had giv'n him quarter, and her blood</span><br/>

<span>Or theirs should make that quarter good;</span><br/>

<span>For she was bound by law of arms</span><br/>

<span>To see him safe from further harms.</span><br/>

<span>In dungeon deep CROWDERO, cast                                945</span><br/>

<span>By HUDIBRAS, as yet lay fast;</span><br/>

<span>Where, to the hard and ruthless stones,</span><br/>

<span>His great heart made perpetual moans:</span><br/>

<span>Him she resolv'd that HUDIBRAS</span><br/>

<span>Should ransom, and supply his place.                          950</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>This stopt their fury, and the basting</span><br/>

<span>Which toward HUDIBRAS was hasting.</span><br/>

<span>They thought it was but just and right,</span><br/>

<span>That what she had atchiev'd in fight,</span><br/>

<span>She should dispose of how she pleas'd.                        955</span><br/>

<span>CROWDERO ought to be releas'd;</span><br/>

<span>Nor could that any way be done</span><br/>

<span>So well as this she pitch'd upon</span><br/>

<span>For who a better could imagine</span><br/>

<span>This therefore they resolv'd t'engage in.                     960</span><br/>

<span>The Knight and Squire first they made</span><br/>

<span>Rise from the ground, where they were laid</span><br/>

<span>Then mounted both upon their horses,</span><br/>

<span>But with their faces to the arses,</span><br/>

<span>ORSIN led HUDIBRAS's beast,                                   965</span><br/>

<span>And TALGOL that which RALPHO prest,</span><br/>

<span>Whom stout MAGNANO, valiant CERDON,</span><br/>

<span>And COLON, waited as a guard on;</span><br/>

<span>All ush'ring TRULLA in the rear,</span><br/>

<span>With th' arms of either prisoner.                             970</span><br/>

<span>In this proud order and array</span><br/>

<span>They put themselves upon their way,</span><br/>

<span>Striving to reach th' enchanted castle,</span><br/>

<span>Where stout CROWDERO in durance lay still.</span><br/>

<span>Thither with greater speed than shows                         975</span><br/>

<span>And triumph over conquer'd foes</span><br/>

<span>Do use t' allow, or than the bears</span><br/>

<span>Or pageants borne before Lord-Mayors</span><br/>

<span>Are wont to use, they soon arriv'd</span><br/>

<span>In order, soldier-like contriv'd;                             980</span><br/>

<span>Still marching in a warlike posture,</span><br/>

<span>As fit for battle as for muster.</span><br/>

<span>The Knight and Squire they first unhorse,</span><br/>

<span>And bending 'gainst the fort their force,</span><br/>

<span>They all advanc'd, and round about                            985</span><br/>

<span>Begirt the magical redoubt.</span><br/>

<span>MAGNAN led up in this adventure,</span><br/>

<span>And made way for the rest to enter;</span><br/>

<span>For he was skilful in black art.</span><br/>

<span>No less than he that built the fort;                          990</span><br/>

<span>And with an iron mace laid flat</span><br/>

<span>A breach, which straight all enter'd at,</span><br/>

<span>And in the wooden dungeon found</span><br/>

<span>CROWDERO laid upon the ground.</span><br/>

<span>Him they release from durance base,                           995</span><br/>

<span>Restor'd t' his fiddle and his case,</span><br/>

<span>And liberty, his thirsty rage</span><br/>

<span>With luscious vengeance to asswage:</span><br/>

<span>For he no sooner was at large,</span><br/>

<span>But TRULLA straight brought on the charge,                   1000</span><br/>

<span>And in the self-same limbo put</span><br/>

<span>The Knight and Squire where he was shut;</span><br/>

<span>Where leaving them in Hockley i' th' Hole,</span><br/>

<span>Their bangs and durance to condole,</span><br/>

<span>Confin'd and conjur'd into narrow                            1005</span><br/>

<span>Enchanted mansion to know sorrow,</span><br/>

<span>In the same order and array</span><br/>

<span>Which they advanc'd, they march'd away.</span><br/>

<span>But HUDIBRAS who scorn'd to stoop</span><br/>

<span>To Fortune, or be said to droop,                             1010</span><br/>

<span>Chear'd up himself with ends of verse,</span><br/>

<span>And sayings of philosophers.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth he, Th' one half of man, his mind,</span><br/>

<span>Is, sui juris, unconfin'd,</span><br/>

<span>And cannot be laid by the heels,                             1015</span><br/>

<span>Whate'er the other moiety feels.</span><br/>

<span>'Tis not restraint or liberty</span><br/>

<span>That makes men prisoners or free;</span><br/>

<span>But perturbations that possess</span><br/>

<span>The mind, or aequanimities.                                  1020</span><br/>

<span>The whole world was not half so wide</span><br/>

<span>To ALEXANDER, when he cry'd,</span><br/>

<span>Because he had but one to subdue,</span><br/>

<span>As was a paltry narrow tub to</span><br/>

<span>DIOGENES; who is not said                                    1025</span><br/>

<span>(For aught that ever I could read)</span><br/>

<span>To whine, put finger i' th' eye, and sob,</span><br/>

<span>Because h' had ne'er another tub.</span><br/>

<span>The ancients make two sev'ral kinds</span><br/>

<span>Of prowess in heroic minds;                                  1030</span><br/>

<span>The active, and the passive valiant;</span><br/>

<span>Both which are pari libra gallant:</span><br/>

<span>For both to give blows, and to carry,</span><br/>

<span>In fights are equinecessary</span><br/>

<span>But in defeats, the passive stout                            1035</span><br/>

<span>Are always found to stand it out</span><br/>

<span>Most desp'rately, and to out-do</span><br/>

<span>The active 'gainst the conqu'ring foe.</span><br/>

<span>Tho' we with blacks and blues are suggill'd,</span><br/>

<span>Or, as the vulgar say, are cudgell'd;                        1040</span><br/>

<span>He that is valiant, and dares fight,</span><br/>

<span>Though drubb'd, can lose no honour by't.</span><br/>

<span>Honour's a lease for lives to come,</span><br/>

<span>And cannot be extended from</span><br/>

<span>The legal tenant: 'tis a chattel                             1045</span><br/>

<span>Not to be forfeited in battel.</span><br/>

<span>If he that in the field is slain,</span><br/>

<span>Be in the bed of Honour lain,</span><br/>

<span>He that is beaten, may be said</span><br/>

<span>To lie in Honour's truckle-bed.                              1050</span><br/>

<span>For as we see th' eclipsed sun</span><br/>

<span>By mortals is more gaz'd upon,</span><br/>

<span>Than when, adorn'd with all his light,</span><br/>

<span>He shines in serene sky most bright:</span><br/>

<span>So valour, in a low estate,                                  1055</span><br/>

<span>Is most admir'd and wonder'd at.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth RALPH, How great I do not know</span><br/>

<span>We may by being beaten grow;</span><br/>

<span>But none, that see how here we sit,</span><br/>

<span>Will judge us overgrown with wit.                            1060</span><br/>

<span>As gifted brethren, preaching by</span><br/>

<span>A carnal hour-glass, do imply,</span><br/>

<span>Illumination can convey</span><br/>

<span>Into them what they have to say,</span><br/>

<span>But not how much; so well enough                             1065</span><br/>

<span>Know you to charge, but not draw off:</span><br/>

<span>For who, without a cap and bauble,</span><br/>

<span>Having subdu'd a bear and rabble,</span><br/>

<span>And might with honour have come off</span><br/>

<span>Would put it to a second proof?                              1070</span><br/>

<span>A politic exploit, right fit</span><br/>

<span>For Presbyterian zeal and wit.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth HUDIBRAS, That cuckow's tone,</span><br/>

<span>RALPHO, thou always harp'st upon.</span><br/>

<span>When thou at any thing would'st rail,                        1075</span><br/>

<span>Thou mak'st Presbytery the scale</span><br/>

<span>To take the height on't, and explain</span><br/>

<span>To what degree it is prophane</span><br/>

<span>Whats'ever will not with (thy what d'ye call)</span><br/>

<span>Thy light jump right, thou call'st synodical;                1080</span><br/>

<span>As if Presbytery were the standard</span><br/>

<span>To size whats'ever's to he slander'd.</span><br/>

<span>Dost not remember how this day,</span><br/>

<span>Thou to my beard wast bold to say,</span><br/>

<span>That thou coud'st prove bear-baiting equal                   1085</span><br/>

<span>With synods orthodox and legal?</span><br/>

<span>Do if thou canst; for I deny't,</span><br/>

<span>And dare thee to 't with all thy light.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth RALPHO, Truly that is no</span><br/>

<span>Hard matter for a man to do,                                 1090</span><br/>

<span>That has but any guts in 's brains,</span><br/>

<span>And cou'd believe it worth his pains;</span><br/>

<span>But since you dare and urge me to it,</span><br/>

<span>You'll find I've light enough to do it.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Synods are mystical bear-gardens,                            1095</span><br/>

<span>Where elders, deputies, church-wardens,</span><br/>

<span>And other members of the court,</span><br/>

<span>Manage the Babylonish sport;</span><br/>

<span>For prolocutor, scribe, and bear-ward,</span><br/>

<span>Do differ only in a mere word;                               1100</span><br/>

<span>Both are but sev'ral synagogues</span><br/>

<span>Of carnal men, and bears, and dogs:</span><br/>

<span>Both antichristian assemblies,</span><br/>

<span>To mischief bent far as in them lies:</span><br/>

<span>Both stave and tail with fierce contests;                    1105</span><br/>

<span>The one with men, the other beasts.</span><br/>

<span>The diff'rence is, the one fights with</span><br/>

<span>The tongue, the other with the teeth;</span><br/>

<span>And that they bait but bears in this,</span><br/>

<span>In th' other, souls and consciences;                         1110</span><br/>

<span>Where Saints themselves are brought to stake</span><br/>

<span>For gospel-light, and conscience sake;</span><br/>

<span>Expos'd to Scribes and Presbyters,</span><br/>

<span>Instead of mastive dogs and curs,</span><br/>

<span>Than whom th' have less humanity;                            1115</span><br/>

<span>For these at souls of men will fly.</span><br/>

<span>This to the prophet did appear,</span><br/>

<span>Who in a vision saw a bear,</span><br/>

<span>Prefiguring the beastly rage</span><br/>

<span>Of Church-rule in this latter age;                           1120</span><br/>

<span>As is demonstrated at full</span><br/>

<span>By him that baited the Pope's Bull.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-78" id="noteref-78" epub:type="noteref">78</a></span><br/>

<span>Bears nat'rally are beasts of prey,</span><br/>

<span>That live by rapine; so do they.</span><br/>

<span>What are their orders, constitutions,                        1125</span><br/>

<span>Church-censures, curses, absolutions,</span><br/>

<span>But' sev'ral mystic chains they make,</span><br/>

<span>To tie poor Christians to the stake,</span><br/>

<span>And then set heathen officers,</span><br/>

<span>Instead of dogs, about their ears?                           1130</span><br/>

<span>For to prohibit and dispense;</span><br/>

<span>To find out or to make offence;</span><br/>

<span>Of Hell and Heaven to dispose;</span><br/>

<span>To play with souls at fast and loose;</span><br/>

<span>To set what characters they please,                          1135</span><br/>

<span>And mulcts on sin or godliness;</span><br/>

<span>Reduce the Church to gospel-order,</span><br/>

<span>By rapine, sacrilege, and murder;</span><br/>

<span>To make Presbytery supreme,</span><br/>

<span>And Kings themselves submit to them;                         1140</span><br/>

<span>And force all people, though against</span><br/>

<span>Their consciences, to turn Saints;</span><br/>

<span>Must prove a pretty thriving trade,</span><br/>

<span>When Saints monopolists are made;</span><br/>

<span>When pious frauds, and holy shifts,                          1145</span><br/>

<span>Are dispensations and gifts,</span><br/>

<span>Their godliness becomes mere ware,</span><br/>

<span>And ev'ry Synod but a fair.</span><br/>

<span>Synods are whelps of th' Inquisition,</span><br/>

<span>A mungrel breed of like pernicion,                           1150</span><br/>

<span>And growing up, became the sires</span><br/>

<span>Of scribes, commissioners, and triers;</span><br/>

<span>Whose bus'ness is, by cunning slight,</span><br/>

<span>To cast a figure for mens' light;</span><br/>

<span>To find, in lines of beard and face,                         1155</span><br/>

<span>The physiognomy of grace;</span><br/>

<span>And by the sound and twang of nose,</span><br/>

<span>If all be sound within disclose,</span><br/>

<span>Free from a crack or flaw of sinning,</span><br/>

<span>As men try pipkins by the ringing;                           1160</span><br/>

<span>By black caps underlaid with white,</span><br/>

<span>Give certain guess at inward light.</span><br/>

<span>Which serjeants at the gospel wear,</span><br/>

<span>To make the spiritual calling clear;</span><br/>

<span>The handkerchief about the neck                              1165</span><br/>

<span>(Canonical cravat of SMECK,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-79" id="noteref-79" epub:type="noteref">79</a></span><br/>

<span>From whom the institution came,</span><br/>

<span>When Church and State they set on flame,</span><br/>

<span>And worn by them as badges then</span><br/>

<span>Of spiritual warfaring men)                                  1170</span><br/>

<span>Judge rightly if regeneration</span><br/>

<span>Be of the newest cut in fashion.</span><br/>

<span>Sure 'tis an orthodox opinion,</span><br/>

<span>That grace is founded in dominion.</span><br/>

<span>Great piety consists in pride;                               1175</span><br/>

<span>To rule is to be sanctified:</span><br/>

<span>To domineer, and to controul,</span><br/>

<span>Both o'er the body and the soul,</span><br/>

<span>Is the most perfect discipline</span><br/>

<span>Of church-rule, and by right-divine.                         1180</span><br/>

<span>Bell and the Dragon's chaplains were</span><br/>

<span>More moderate than these by far:</span><br/>

<span>For they (poor knaves) were glad to cheat,</span><br/>

<span>To get their wives and children meat;</span><br/>

<span>But these will not be fobb'd off so;                         1185</span><br/>

<span>They must have wealth and power too,</span><br/>

<span>Or else with blood and desolation</span><br/>

<span>They'll tear it out o' th' heart o' th' nation.</span><br/>

<span>Sure these themselves from primitive</span><br/>

<span>And Heathen Priesthood do derive,                            1190</span><br/>

<span>When butchers were the only Clerks,</span><br/>

<span>Elders and Presbyters of Kirks;</span><br/>

<span>Whose directory was to kill;</span><br/>

<span>And some believe it is so still.</span><br/>

<span>The only diff'rence is, that then                            1195</span><br/>

<span>They slaughter'd only beasts, now men.</span><br/>

<span>For then to sacrifice a bullock,</span><br/>

<span>Or now and then a child to Moloch,</span><br/>

<span>They count a vile abomination,</span><br/>

<span>But not to slaughter a whole nation.                         1200</span><br/>

<span>Presbytery does but translate</span><br/>

<span>The Papacy to a free state;</span><br/>

<span>A commonwealth of Popery,</span><br/>

<span>Where ev'ry village is a See</span><br/>

<span>As well as Rome, and must maintain                           1205</span><br/>

<span>A Tithe-pig Metropolitan;</span><br/>

<span>Where ev'ry Presbyter and Deacon</span><br/>

<span>Commands the keys for cheese and bacon;</span><br/>

<span>And ev'ry hamlet's governed</span><br/>

<span>By's Holiness, the Church's Head;                            1210</span><br/>

<span>More haughty and severe in's place,</span><br/>

<span>Than GREGORY or BONIFACE.</span><br/>

<span>Such Church must (surely) be a monster</span><br/>

<span>With many heads: for if we conster</span><br/>

<span>What in th' Apocalypse we find,                              1215</span><br/>

<span>According to th' Apostle's mind,</span><br/>

<span>'Tis that the Whore of Babylon</span><br/>

<span>With many heads did ride upon;</span><br/>

<span>Which heads denote the sinful tribe</span><br/>

<span>Of Deacon, Priest, Lay-Elder, Scribe.                        1220</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Lay-Elder, SIMEON to LEVI,</span><br/>

<span>Whose little finger is as heavy</span><br/>

<span>As loins of patriarchs, prince-prelate,</span><br/>

<span>And bishop-secular. This zealot</span><br/>

<span>Is of a mungrel, diverse kind;                               1225</span><br/>

<span>Cleric before, and lay behind;</span><br/>

<span>A lawless linsie-woolsie brother,</span><br/>

<span>Half of one order, half another;</span><br/>

<span>A creature of amphibious nature;</span><br/>

<span>On land a beast, a fish in water;                            1230</span><br/>

<span>That always preys on grace or sin;</span><br/>

<span>A sheep without, a wolf within.</span><br/>

<span>This fierce inquisitor has chief</span><br/>

<span>Dominion over men's belief</span><br/>

<span>And manners: can pronounce a Saint                           1235</span><br/>

<span>Idolatrous or ignorant,</span><br/>

<span>When superciliously he sifts</span><br/>

<span>Through coarsest boulter others' gifts;</span><br/>

<span>For all men live and judge amiss,</span><br/>

<span>Whose talents jump not just with his.                        1240</span><br/>

<span>He'll lay on gifts with hands, and place</span><br/>

<span>On dullest noddle Light and Grace,</span><br/>

<span>The manufacture of the Kirk.</span><br/>

<span>Those pastors are but th' handy-work</span><br/>

<span>Of his mechanic paws, instilling                             1245</span><br/>

<span>Divinity in them by feeling;</span><br/>

<span>From whence they start up Chosen Vessels,</span><br/>

<span>Made by contact, as men get meazles.</span><br/>

<span>So Cardinals, they say, do grope</span><br/>

<span>At th' other end the new-made Pope.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-80" id="noteref-80" epub:type="noteref">80</a>                          1250</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Hold, hold, quoth HUDIBRAS; soft fire,</span><br/>

<span>They say, does make sweet malt. Good Squire,</span><br/>

<span>Festina lente, not too fast;</span><br/>

<span>For haste (the proverb says) makes waste.</span><br/>

<span>The quirks and cavils thou dost make                         1255</span><br/>

<span>Are false, and built upon mistake:</span><br/>

<span>And I shall bring you, with your pack</span><br/>

<span>Of fallacies, t' elenchi back;</span><br/>

<span>And put your arguments in mood</span><br/>

<span>And figure to be understood.                                 1260</span><br/>

<span>I'll force you, by right ratiocination,</span><br/>

<span>To leave your vitilitigation,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-81" id="noteref-81" epub:type="noteref">81</a></span><br/>

<span>And make you keep to th' question close,</span><br/>

<span>And argue dialecticos.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>The question then, to state it first,                        1265</span><br/>

<span>Is, Which is better, or which worst,</span><br/>

<span>Synods or Bears? Bears I avow</span><br/>

<span>To be the worst, and Synods thou.</span><br/>

<span>But, to make good th' assertion,</span><br/>

<span>Thou say'st th' are really all one.                          1270</span><br/>

<span>If so, not worst; for if th' are idem</span><br/>

<span>Why then, tantundem dat tantidem.</span><br/>

<span>For if they are the same, by course,</span><br/>

<span>Neither is better, neither worse.</span><br/>

<span>But I deny they are the same,                                1275</span><br/>

<span>More than a maggot and I am.</span><br/>

<span>That both are animalia</span><br/>

<span>I grant, but not rationalia:</span><br/>

<span>For though they do agree in kind,</span><br/>

<span>Specific difference we find;                                 1280</span><br/>

<span>And can no more make bears of these,</span><br/>

<span>Than prove my horse is SOCRATES.</span><br/>

<span>That Synods are bear-gardens too,</span><br/>

<span>Thou dost affirm; but I say no:</span><br/>

<span>And thus I prove it in a word;                               1285</span><br/>

<span>Whats'ver assembly's not impow'r'd</span><br/>

<span>To censure, curse, absolve, and ordain,</span><br/>

<span>Can be no Synod: but bear-garden</span><br/>

<span>Has no such pow'r; ergo, 'tis none:</span><br/>

<span>And so thy sophistry's o'erthrown.                           1290</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>But yet we are beside the question</span><br/>

<span>Which thou didst raise the first contest on;</span><br/>

<span>For that was, Whether Bears are better</span><br/>

<span>Than Synod-men? I say, Negatur.</span><br/>

<span>That bears are beasts, and synods men,                       1295</span><br/>

<span>Is held by all: they're better then:</span><br/>

<span>For bears and dogs on four legs go,</span><br/>

<span>As beasts, but Synod-men on two.</span><br/>

<span>'Tis true, they all have teeth and nails;</span><br/>

<span>But prove that Synod-men have tails;                         1300</span><br/>

<span>Or that a rugged, shaggy fur</span><br/>

<span>Grows o'er the hide of Presbyter;</span><br/>

<span>Or that his snout and spacious ears</span><br/>

<span>Do hold proportion with a bear's.</span><br/>

<span>A bears a savage beast, of all                               1305</span><br/>

<span>Most ugly and unnatural</span><br/>

<span>Whelp'd without form, until the dam</span><br/>

<span>Has lick'd it into shape and frame:</span><br/>

<span>But all thy light can ne'er evict,</span><br/>

<span>That ever Synod-man was lick'd;                              1310</span><br/>

<span>Or brought to any other fashion,</span><br/>

<span>Than his own will and inclination.</span><br/>

<span>But thou dost further yet in this</span><br/>

<span>Oppugn thyself and sense; that is,</span><br/>

<span>Thou would'st have Presbyters to go                          1315</span><br/>

<span>For bears and dogs, and bearwards too;</span><br/>

<span>A strange chimera of beasts and men,</span><br/>

<span>Made up of pieces heterogene;</span><br/>

<span>Such as in nature never met</span><br/>

<span>In eodem subjecto yet.                                       1320</span><br/>

<span>Thy other arguments are all</span><br/>

<span>Supposures, hypothetical,</span><br/>

<span>That do but beg, and we may chose</span><br/>

<span>Either to grant them, or refuse.</span><br/>

<span>Much thou hast said, which I know when                       1325</span><br/>

<span>And where thou stol'st from other men,</span><br/>

<span>Whereby 'tis plain thy Light and Gifts</span><br/>

<span>Are all but plagiary shifts;</span><br/>

<span>And is the same that Ranter said,</span><br/>

<span>Who, arguing with me, broke my head,                         1330</span><br/>

<span>And tore a handful of my beard:</span><br/>

<span>The self-same cavils then I heard,</span><br/>

<span>When, b'ing in hot dispute about</span><br/>

<span>This controversy, we fell out</span><br/>

<span>And what thou know'st I answer'd then,                       1335</span><br/>

<span>Will serve to answer thee agen.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth RALPHO, Nothing but th' abuse</span><br/>

<span>Of human learning you produce;</span><br/>

<span>Learning, that cobweb of the brain,</span><br/>

<span>Profane, erroneous, and vain;                                1340</span><br/>

<span>A trade of knowledge, as replete</span><br/>

<span>As others are with fraud and cheat;</span><br/>

<span>An art t'incumber gifts and wit,</span><br/>

<span>And render both for nothing fit;</span><br/>

<span>Makes Light unactive, dull, and troubled,                    1345</span><br/>

<span>Like little DAVID in SAUL's doublet;</span><br/>

<span>A cheat that scholars put upon</span><br/>

<span>Other mens' reason and their own;</span><br/>

<span>A fort of error, to ensconce</span><br/>

<span>Absurdity and ignorance,                                     1350</span><br/>

<span>That renders all the avenues</span><br/>

<span>To truth impervious and abstruse,</span><br/>

<span>By making plain things, in debate,</span><br/>

<span>By art, perplex'd, and intricate</span><br/>

<span>For nothing goes for sense or light                          1355</span><br/>

<span>That will not with old rules jump right:</span><br/>

<span>As if rules were not in the schools</span><br/>

<span>Deriv'd from truth, but truth from rules.</span><br/>

<span>This pagan, heathenish invention</span><br/>

<span>Is good for nothing but contention.                          1360</span><br/>

<span>For as, in sword-and-buckler fight,</span><br/>

<span>All blows do on the target light;</span><br/>

<span>So when men argue, the great'st part</span><br/>

<span>O' th' contests falls on terms of art,</span><br/>

<span>Until the fustian stuff be spent,                            1365</span><br/>

<span>And then they fall to th' argument.</span><br/>
</p>

<p>
<span>Quoth HUDIBRAS Friend RALPH, thou hast</span><br/>

<span>Out-run the constable at last:</span><br/>

<span>For thou art fallen on a new</span><br/>

<span>Dispute, as senseless as untrue,                             1370</span><br/>

<span>But to the former opposite</span><br/>

<span>And contrary as black to white;</span><br/>

<span>Mere disparata;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-82" id="noteref-82" epub:type="noteref">82</a> that concerning</span><br/>

<span>Presbytery; this, human learning;</span><br/>

<span>Two things s'averse, they never yet                          1375</span><br/>

<span>But in thy rambling fancy met.</span><br/>

<span>But I shall take a fit occasion</span><br/>

<span>T' evince thee by ratiocination,</span><br/>

<span>Some other time, in place more proper</span><br/>

<span>Than this we're in; therefore let's stop here,               1380</span><br/>

<span>And rest our weary'd bones a-while,</span><br/>

<span>Already tir'd with other toil.</span><br/>
