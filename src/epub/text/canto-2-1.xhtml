<p id="id00240" style="margin-top: 2em">But now, t'observe a romantic method,<br/>

Let bloody steel a while be sheathed,<br/>

And all those harsh and rugged sounds<br/>

Of bastinadoes, cuts, and wounds,<br/>

Exchang'd to Love's more gentle stile,                          5<br/>

To let our reader breathe a while;<br/>

In which, that we may be as brief as<br/>

Is possible, by way of preface,<br/>

Is't not enough to make one strange,<br/>

That some men's fancies should ne'er change,                   10<br/>

But make all people do and say<br/>

The same things still the self-same way<br/>

Some writers make all ladies purloin'd,<br/>

And knights pursuing like a whirlwind<br/>

Others make all their knights, in fits                         15<br/>

Of jealousy, to lose their wits;<br/>

Till drawing blood o'th' dames, like witches,<br/>

Th' are forthwith cur'd of their capriches.<br/>

Some always thrive in their amours<br/>

By pulling plaisters off their sores;                          20<br/>

As cripples do to get an alms,<br/>

Just so do they, and win their dames.<br/>

Some force whole regions, in despight<br/>

O' geography, to change their site;<br/>

Make former times shake hands with latter,                     25<br/>

And that which was before, come after.<br/>

But those that write in rhime, still make<br/>

The one verse for the other's sake;<br/>

For, one for sense, and one for rhime,<br/>

I think's sufficient at one time.                              30<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00241">But we forget in what sad plight<br/>

We whilom left the captiv'd Knight<br/>

And pensive Squire, both bruis'd in body,<br/>

And conjur'd into safe custody.<br/>

Tir'd with dispute and speaking Latin,                         35<br/>

As well as basting and bear-baiting,<br/>

And desperate of any course,<br/>

To free himself by wit or force,<br/>

His only solace was, that now<br/>

His dog-bolt fortune was so low,                               40<br/>

That either it must quickly end<br/>

Or turn about again, and mend;<br/>

In which he found th' event, no less<br/>

Than other times beside his guess.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00242">There is a tall long sided dame                                45<br/>

(But wond'rous light,) ycleped Fame<br/>

That, like a thin camelion, boards<br/>

Herself on air, and eats her words;<br/>

Upon her shoulders wings she wears<br/>

Like hanging-sleeves, lin'd through with ears,                 50<br/>

And eyes, and tongues, as poets list,<br/>

Made good by deep mythologist,<br/>

With these she through the welkin flies,<br/>

And sometimes carries truth, oft lies<br/>

With letters hung like eastern pigeons,                        55<br/>

And Mercuries of furthest regions;<br/>

Diurnals writ for regulation<br/>

Of lying, to inform the nation;<br/>

And by their public use to bring down<br/>

The rate of whetstones in the kingdom.                         60<br/>

About her neck a pacquet-male,<br/>

Fraught with advice, some fresh, some stale,<br/>

Of men that walk'd when they were dead,<br/>

And cows of monsters brought to bed;<br/>

Of hail-stones big as pullets eggs,                            65<br/>

And puppies whelp'd with twice two legs;<br/>

A blazing star seen in the west,<br/>

By six or seven men at least.<br/>

Two trumpets she does sound at once,<br/>

But both of clean contrary tones;                              70<br/>

But whether both with the same wind,<br/>

Or one before, and one behind,<br/>

We know not; only this can tell,<br/>

The one sounds vilely, th' other well;<br/>

And therefore vulgar authors name                              75<br/>

Th' one Good, the other Evil, Fame.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00243">This tattling gossip knew too well<br/>

What mischief HUDIBRAS befell.<br/>

And straight the spiteful tidings bears<br/>

Of all to th' unkind widow's ears.                             80<br/>

DEMOCRITUS ne'er laugh'd so loud<br/>

To see bawds carted through the crowd,<br/>

Or funerals with stately pomp<br/>

March slowly on in solemn dump,<br/>

As she laugh'd out, until her back,                            85<br/>

As well as sides, was like to crack.<br/>

She vow'd she would go see the sight,<br/>

And visit the distressed Knight;<br/>

To do the office of a neighbour,<br/>

And be a gossip at his labour;                                 90<br/>

And from his wooden jail, the stocks,<br/>

To set at large his fetter-locks;<br/>

And, by exchange, parole, or ransom,<br/>

To free him from th' enchanted mansion.<br/>

This b'ing resolv'd, she call'd for hood                       95<br/>

And usher, implements abroad<br/>

Which ladies wear, beside a slender<br/>

Young waiting damsel to attend her;<br/>

All which appearing, on she went,<br/>

To find the Knight in limbo pent.                             100<br/>

And 'twas not long before she found<br/>

Him, and the stout Squire, in the pound;<br/>

Both coupled in enchanted tether,<br/>

By further leg behind together<br/>

For as he sat upon his rump,                                  105<br/>

His head like one in doleful dump,<br/>

Between his knees, his hands apply'd<br/>

Unto his ears on either side;<br/>

And by him, in another hole,<br/>

Afflicted RALPHO, cheek by jowl;                              110<br/>

She came upon him in his wooden<br/>

Magician's circle on the sudden,<br/>

As spirits do t' a conjurer,<br/>

When in their dreadful shapes th' appear.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00244">No sooner did the Knight perceive her,                        115<br/>

But straight he fell into a fever,<br/>

Inflam'd all over with disgrace,<br/>

To be seen by her in such a place;<br/>

Which made him hang his head, and scoul,<br/>

And wink, and goggle like an owl.                             120<br/>

He felt his brains begin to swim,<br/>

When thus the dame accosted him:<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00245">This place (quoth she) they say's enchanted,<br/>

And with delinquent spirits haunted,<br/>

That here are ty'd in chains, and scourg'd,                   125<br/>

Until their guilty crimes be purg'd.<br/>

Look, there are two of them appear,<br/>

Like persons I have seen somewhere.<br/>

Some have mistaken blocks and posts<br/>

For spectres, apparitions, ghosts,                            130<br/>

With saucer eyes, and horns; and some<br/>

Have heard the Devil beat a drum:<br/>

But if our eyes are not false glasses,<br/>

That give a wrong account of faces,<br/>

That beard and I should be acquainted,                        135<br/>

Before 'twas conjur'd or enchanted;<br/>

For though it be disfigur'd somewhat,<br/>

As if 't had lately been in combat,<br/>

It did belong to a worthy Knight<br/>

Howe'er this goblin has come by't.                            140<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00246">When HUDIBRAS the Lady heard<br/>

Discoursing thus upon his beard,<br/>

And speak with such respect and honour,<br/>

Both of the beard and the beard's owner,<br/>

He thought it best to set as good                             145<br/>

A face upon it as he cou'd,<br/>

And thus he spoke: Lady, your bright<br/>

And radiant eyes are in the right:<br/>

The beard's th' identic beard you knew,<br/>

The same numerically true:                                    150<br/>

Nor is it worn by fiend or elf,<br/>

But its proprietor himself.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00247">O, heavens! quoth she, can that be true?<br/>

I do begin to fear 'tis you:<br/>

Not by your individual whiskers,                              155<br/>

But by your dialect and discourse,<br/>

That never spoke to man or beast<br/>

In notions vulgarly exprest.<br/>

But what malignant star, alas<br/>

Has brought you both to this sad pass?                        160<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00248">Quoth he, The fortune of the war,<br/>

Which I am less afflicted for,<br/>

Than to be seen with beard and face,<br/>

By you in such a homely case.<br/>

Quoth she, Those need not he asham'd                          165<br/>

For being honorably maim'd,<br/>

If he that is in battle conquer'd,<br/>

Have any title to his own beard;<br/>

Though yours be sorely lugg'd and torn,<br/>

It does your visage more adorn                                170<br/>

Than if 'twere prun'd, and starch'd, and lander'd,<br/>

And cut square by the Russian standard.<br/>

A torn beard's like a tatter'd ensign,<br/>

That's bravest which there are most rents in.<br/>

That petticoat about your shoulders                           175<br/>

Does not so well become a souldier's;<br/>

And I'm afraid they are worse handled<br/>

Although i' th' rear; your beard the van led;<br/>

And those uneasy bruises make<br/>

My heart for company to ake,                                  180<br/>

To see so worshipful a friend<br/>

I' th' pillory set, at the wrong end.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00249">Quoth HUDIBRAS, This thing call'd pain<br/>

Is (as the learned Stoicks maintain)<br/>

Not bad simpliciter, nor good,                                185<br/>

But merely as 'tis understood.<br/>

Sense is deceitful, and may feign,<br/>

As well in counterfeiting pain<br/>

As other gross phenomenas,<br/>

In which it oft mistakes the case.                            190<br/>

But since the immortal intellect<br/>

(That's free from error and defect,<br/>

Whose objects still persist the same)<br/>

Is free from outward bruise and maim,<br/>

Which nought external can expose                              195<br/>

To gross material bangs or blows,<br/>

It follows, we can ne'er be sure,<br/>

Whether we pain or not endure;<br/>

And just so far are sore and griev'd,<br/>

As by the fancy is believ'd.                                  200<br/>

Some have been wounded with conceit,<br/>

And dy'd of mere opinion straight;<br/>

Others, tho' wounded sore in reason,<br/>

Felt no contusion, nor discretion.<br/>

A Saxon  Duke did grow so fat,                                205<br/>

That mice (as histories relate)<br/>

Eat grots and labyrinths to dwell in<br/>

His postick parts without his feeling:<br/>

Then how is't possible a kick<br/>

Should e'er reach that way to the quick?                      210<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00250">Quoth she, I grant it is in vain.<br/>

For one that's basted to feel pain,<br/>

Because the pangs his bones endure<br/>

Contribute nothing to the cure:<br/>

Yet honor hurt, is wont to rage                               215<br/>

With pain no med'cine can asswage.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00251">Quoth he, That honour's very squeamish<br/>

That takes a basting for a blemish;<br/>

For what's more hon'rable than scars,<br/>

Or skin to tatters rent in wars?                              220<br/>

Some have been beaten till they know<br/>

What wood a cudgel's of by th' blow;<br/>

Some kick'd until they can feel whether<br/>

A shoe be Spanish or neat's leather;<br/>

And yet have met, after long running,                         225<br/>

With some whom they have taught that cunning.<br/>

The furthest way about t' o'ercome,<br/>

In the end does prove the nearest home.<br/>

By laws of learned duellists,<br/>

They that are bruis'd with wood or fists,                     230<br/>

And think one beating may for once<br/>

Suffice, are cowards and pultroons:<br/>

But if they dare engage t' a second,<br/>

They're stout and gallant fellows reckon'd.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00252">Th' old Romans freedom did bestow,                            235<br/>

Our princes worship, with a blow.<br/>

King PYRRHUS cur'd his  splenetic<br/>

And testy courtiers with a kick.<br/>

The NEGUS, when some mighty lord<br/>

Or potentate's to be restor'd                                 240<br/>

And pardon'd for some great offence,<br/>

With which be's willing to dispense,<br/>

First has him laid upon his belly,<br/>

Then beaten back and side to a jelly;<br/>

That done, he rises, humbly bows,                             245<br/>

And gives thanks for the princely blows;<br/>

Departs not meanly proud, and boasting<br/>

Of this magnificent rib-roasting.<br/>

The beaten soldier proves most manful,<br/>

That, like his sword, endures the anvil,                      250<br/>

And justly's held more formidable,<br/>

The more his valour's malleable:<br/>

But he that fears a bastinado<br/>

Will run away from his own shadow:<br/>

And though I'm now in durance fast,                           255<br/>

By our own party basely cast,<br/>

Ransom, exchange, parole refus'd,<br/>

And worse than by the enemy us'd;<br/>

In close catasta shut, past hope<br/>

Of wit or valour to elope;                                    260<br/>

As beards the nearer that they tend<br/>

To th' earth still grow more reverend;<br/>

And cannons shoot the higher pitches,<br/>

The lower we let down their breeches;<br/>

I'll make this low dejected fate                              265<br/>

Advance me to a greater height.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00253">Quoth she, Y' have almost made me in love<br/>

With that which did my pity move.<br/>

Great wits and valours, like great states,<br/>

Do sometimes sink with their own weights:<br/>

Th' extremes of glory and of shame,                           270<br/>

Like East and West, become the same:<br/>

No Indian Prince has to his palace<br/>

More foll'wers than a thief to th' gallows,<br/>

But if a beating seem so brave,                               275<br/>

What glories must a whipping have<br/>

Such great atchievements cannot fail<br/>

To cast salt on a woman's tail:<br/>

For if I thought your nat'ral talent<br/>

Of passive courage were so gallant,                           280<br/>

As you strain hard to have it thought,<br/>

I could grow amorous, and dote.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00254">When HUDIBRAS this language heard,<br/>

He prick'd up's ears and strok'd his beard;<br/>

Thought he, this is the lucky hour;                           285<br/>

Wines work when vines are in the flow'r;<br/>

This crisis then I'll set my rest on,<br/>

And put her boldly to the question.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00255">Madam, what you wou'd seem to doubt,<br/>

Shall be to all the world made out,                           290<br/>

How I've been drubb'd, and with what spirit<br/>

And magnanimity I bear it;<br/>

And if you doubt it to be true,<br/>

I'll stake myself down against you:<br/>

And if I fail in love or troth,                               295<br/>

Be you the winner, and take both.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00256">Quoth she, I've beard old cunning stagers<br/>

Say, fools for arguments use wagers;<br/>

And though I prais'd your valour, yet<br/>

I did not mean to baulk your wit;                             300<br/>

Which, if you have, you must needs know<br/>

What I have told you before now,<br/>

And you b' experiment have prov'd,<br/>

I cannot love where I'm belov'd.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00257">Quoth HUDIBRAS, 'tis a caprich                                305<br/>

Beyond th' infliction of a witch;<br/>

So cheats to play with those still aim<br/>

That do not understand the game.<br/>

Love in your heart as icily burns<br/>

As fire in antique Roman urns,                                310<br/>

To warm the dead, and vainly light<br/>

Those only that see nothing by't.<br/>

Have you not power to entertain,<br/>

And render love for love again;<br/>

As no man can draw in his breath                              315<br/>

At once, and force out air beneath?<br/>

Or do you love yourself so much,<br/>

To bear all rivals else a grutch?<br/>

What fate can lay a greater curse<br/>

Than you upon yourself would force?                           320<br/>

For wedlock without love, some say,<br/>

Is but a lock without a key.<br/>

It is a kind of rape to marry<br/>

One that neglects, or cares not for ye:<br/>

For what does make it ravishment,                             325<br/>

But b'ing against the mind's consent?<br/>

A rape that is the more inhuman<br/>

For being acted by a woman.<br/>

Why are you fair, but to entice us<br/>

To love you, that you may despise us?                         330<br/>

But though you cannot Love, you say,<br/>

Out of your own fanatick way,<br/>

Why should you not at least allow<br/>

Those that love you to do so too?<br/>

For, as you fly me, and pursue                                330<br/>

Love more averse, so I do you;<br/>

And am by your own doctrine taught<br/>

To practise what you call a fau't.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00258">Quoth she, If what you say is true,<br/>

You must fly me as I do you;                                  340<br/>

But 'tis not what we do, but say,<br/>

In love and preaching, that must sway.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00259">Quoth he, To bid me not to love,<br/>

Is to forbid my pulse to move,<br/>

My beard to grow, my ears to prick up,                        345<br/>

Or (when I'm in a fit) to hickup:<br/>

Command me to piss out the moon,<br/>

And 'twill as easily be done:<br/>

Love's power's too great to be withstood<br/>

By feeble human flesh and blood.                              350<br/>

'Twas he that brought upon his knees<br/>

The hect'ring, kill-cow HERCULES;<br/>

Transform'd his leager-lion's skin<br/>

T' a petticoat, and made him spin;<br/>

Seiz'd on his club, and made it dwindle                       355<br/>

T' a feeble distaff, and a spindle.<br/>

'Twas he that made emperors gallants<br/>

To their own sisters and their aunts;<br/>

Set popes and cardinals agog,<br/>

To play with pages at leap-frog.                              360<br/>

'Twas he that gave our Senate purges,<br/>

And flux'd the House of many a burgess;<br/>

Made those that represent the nation<br/>

Submit, and suffer amputation;<br/>

And all the Grandees o' the Cabal                             365<br/>

Adjourn to tubs at Spring and Fall.<br/>

He mounted Synod-Men, and rode 'em<br/>

To Dirty-Lane and Little Sodom;<br/>

Made 'em curvet like Spanish jenets,<br/>

And take the ring at Madam [Bennet's]                         370<br/>

'Twas he that made  Saint FRANCIS do<br/>

More than the Devil could tempt him to,<br/>

In cold and frosty weather, grow<br/>

Enamour'd of a wife of snow;<br/>

And though she were of rigid temper,                          375<br/>

With melting flames accost and tempt her;<br/>

Which after in enjoyment quenching,<br/>

He hung a garland on his engine<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00260">Quoth she, If Love have these effects,<br/>

Why is it not forbid our sex?                                 380<br/>

Why is't not damn'd and interdicted,<br/>

For diabolical and wicked?<br/>

And sung, as out of tune, against,<br/>

As Turk and Pope are by the Saints?<br/>

I find I've greater reason for it,                            385<br/>

Than I believ'd before t' abhor it.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00261">Quoth HUDIBRAS, These sad effects<br/>

Spring from your Heathenish neglects<br/>

Of Love's great pow'r, which he returns<br/>

Upon yourselves with equal scorns;                            390<br/>

And those who worthy lovers slight,<br/>

Plagues with prepost'rous appetite.<br/>

This made the beauteous Queen of Crete<br/>

To take a town-bull for her sweet,<br/>

And from her greatness stoop so low,                          395<br/>

To be the rival of a cow:<br/>

Others to prostitute their great hearts,<br/>

To he baboons' and monkeys' sweet-hearts;<br/>

Some with the Dev'l himself in league grow,<br/>

By's representative a Negro.                                  400<br/>

'Twas this made vestal-maids love-sick,<br/>

And venture to be bury'd quick:<br/>

Some by their fathers, and their brothers,<br/>

To be made mistresses and mothers.<br/>

'Tis this that proudest dames enamours                        405<br/>

On lacquies and valets des chambres;<br/>

Their haughty stomachs overcomes,<br/>

And makes 'em stoop to dirty grooms;<br/>

To slight the world, and to disparage<br/>

Claps, issue, infamy, and marriage.                           410<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00262">Quoth she, These judgments are severe,<br/>

Yet such as I should rather bear,<br/>

Than trust men with their oaths, or prove<br/>

Their faith and secresy in love,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00263">Says he, There is as weighty reason                           415<br/>

For secresy in love as treason.<br/>

Love is a burglarer, a felon,<br/>

That at the windore-eyes does steal in<br/>

To rob the heart, and with his prey<br/>

Steals out again a closer way,                                420<br/>

Which whosoever can discover,<br/>

He's sure (as he deserves) to suffer.<br/>

Love is a fire, that burns and sparkles<br/>

In men as nat'rally as in charcoals,<br/>

Which sooty chymists stop in holes                            425<br/>

When out of wood they extract coals:<br/>

So lovers should their passions choak,<br/>

That, tho' they burn, they may not smoak.<br/>

'Tis like that sturdy thief that stole<br/>

And dragg'd beasts backwards into's hole:                     430<br/>

So Love does lovers, and us men<br/>

Draws by the tails into his den,<br/>

That no impression may discover,<br/>

And trace t' his cave, the wary lover,<br/>

But if you doubt I should reveal                              435<br/>

What you entrust me under seal.<br/>

I'll prove myself as close and virtuous<br/>

As your own secretary ALBERTUS.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00264">Quoth she, I grant you may be close<br/>

In hiding what your aims propose.                             440<br/>

Love-passions are like parables,<br/>

By which men still mean something else,<br/>

Though love be all the world's pretence,<br/>

Money's the mythologick sense;<br/>

The real substance of the shadow,                             445<br/>

Which all address and courtship's made to.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00265">Thought he, I understand your play,<br/>

And how to quit you your own way:<br/>

He that will win his dame, must do<br/>

As Love does when he bends his bow;                           450<br/>

With one hand thrust the lady from,<br/>

And with the other pull her home.<br/>

I grant, quoth he, wealth is a great<br/>

Provocative to am'rous heat.<br/>

It is all philters, and high diet,                            455<br/>

That makes love rampant, and to fly out:<br/>

'Tis beauty always in the flower,<br/>

That buds and blossoms at fourscore:<br/>

'Tis that by which the sun and moon<br/>

At their own weapons are out-done:                            460<br/>

That makes Knights-Errant fall in trances,<br/>

And lay about 'em in romances:<br/>

'Tis virtue, wit, and worth, and all<br/>

That men divine and sacred call:<br/>

For what is worth in any thing,                               465<br/>

But so much money as 'twill bring?<br/>

Or what, but riches is there known,<br/>

Which man can solely call his own<br/>

In which no creature goes his half;<br/>

Unless it be to  squint and laugh?                            470<br/>

I do confess, with goods and land,<br/>

I'd have a wife at second-hand;<br/>

And such you are. Nor is 't your person<br/>

My stomach's set so sharp and fierce on;<br/>

But 'tis (your better part) your riches,                      475<br/>

That my enamour'd heart bewitches.<br/>

Let me your fortune but possess,<br/>

And settle your person how you please:<br/>

Or make it o'er in trust to th' Devil;<br/>

You'll find me reasonable and civil.                          480<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00266">Quoth she, I like this plainness better<br/>

Than false mock-passion, speech, or letter,<br/>

Or any feat of qualm or sowning,<br/>

But hanging of yourself, or drowning.<br/>

Your only way with me to break                                485<br/>

Your mind, is breaking of your neck;<br/>

For as when merchants break, o'erthrown,<br/>

Like nine-pins they strike others down,<br/>

So that would break my heart; which done,<br/>

My tempting fortune is your own,                              490<br/>

These are but trifles: ev'ry lover<br/>

Will damn himself over and over,<br/>

And greater matters undertake<br/>

For a less worthy mistress' sake:<br/>

Yet th' are the only ways to prove                            495<br/>

Th' unfeign'd realities of love:<br/>

For he that hangs, or beats out's brains,<br/>

The Devil's in him if he feigns.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00267">Quoth HUDIBRAS, This way's too rough<br/>

For mere experiment and proof:                                500<br/>

It is no jesting, trivial matter,<br/>

To swing t' th' air, or douce in Water,<br/>

And, like a water-witch, try love;<br/>

That's to destroy, and not to prove;<br/>

As if a man should be dissected                               505<br/>

To find what part is disaffected.<br/>

Your better way is to make over,<br/>

In trust, your fortune to your lover.<br/>

Trust is a trial; if it break,<br/>

'Tis not so desp'rate as a neck.                              510<br/>

Beside, th' experiment's more certain;<br/>

Men venture necks to gain a fortune:<br/>

The soldier does it ev'ry day.<br/>

(Eight to the week) for sixpence pay:<br/>

Your pettifoggers damn their souls,                           515<br/>

To share with knaves in cheating fools:<br/>

And merchants, vent'ring through the main,<br/>

Slight pirates, rocks, and horns, for gain.<br/>

This is the way I advise you to:<br/>

Trust me, and see what I will do.                             520<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00268">Quoth she, I should be loth to run<br/>

Myself all th' hazard, and you none;<br/>

Which must be done, unless some deed<br/>

Of your's aforesaid do precede.<br/>

Give but yourself one gentle swing                            525<br/>

For trial, and I'll cut the string:<br/>

Or give that rev'rend head a maul,<br/>

Or two, or three, against a wall,<br/>

To shew you are a man of mettle,<br/>

And I'll engage myself to settle.                             530<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00269">Quoth he, My head's not made of brass,<br/>

As Friar BACON'S noodle was;<br/>

Nor (like the Indian's skull) so tough<br/>

That, authors say, 'twas musket-proof,<br/>

As yet on any new adventure,                                  535<br/>

As it had need to be, to enter.<br/>

You see what bangs it has endur'd,<br/>

That would, before new feats, be cur'd.<br/>

But if that's all you stand upon,<br/>

Here, strike me luck, it shall be done.                       540<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00270">Quoth she, The matter's not so far gone<br/>

As you suppose: Two words t' a bargain:<br/>

That may be done, and time enough,<br/>

When you have given downright proof;<br/>

And yet 'tis no fantastic pique                               545<br/>

I have to love, nor coy dislike:<br/>

'Tis no implicit, nice aversion<br/>

T' your conversation, mein, or person,<br/>

But a just fear, lest you should prove<br/>

False and perfidious in love:,                                550<br/>

For if I thought you could be true,<br/>

I could love twice as much as you.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00271">Quoth he, My faith as adamanatine,<br/>

As chains of destiny, I'll maintain:<br/>

True as APOLLO ever spoke,                                    555<br/>

Or Oracle from heart of oak;<br/>

And if you'll give my flame but vent,<br/>

Now in close hugger-mugger pent,<br/>

And shine upon me but benignly,<br/>

With that one, and that other pigsney,                        560<br/>

The sun and day shall sooner part,<br/>

Than love or you shake off my heart;<br/>

The sun, that shall no more dispense<br/>

His own but your bright influence.<br/>

I'll carve your name on barks of trees,                       565<br/>

With true-loves-knots and flourishes,<br/>

That shall infuse eternal spring,<br/>

And everlasting flourishing:<br/>

Drink ev'ry letter on't in stum,<br/>

And make it brisk champaign become;                           570<br/>

Where-e'er you tread, your foot shall set<br/>

The primrose and the violet:<br/>

All spices, perfumes, and sweet powders,<br/>

Shall borrow from your breath their odours:<br/>

Nature her charter shall renew,                               575<br/>

And take all lives of things from you;<br/>

The world depend upon your eye,<br/>

And when you frown upon it, die:<br/>

Only our loves shall still survive,<br/>

New worlds and natures to out-live:                           580<br/>

And, like to heralds' moons, remain<br/>

All crescents, without change or wane.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00272">Hold, hold, quoth she; no more of this,<br/>

Sir Knight; you take your aim amiss:<br/>

For you will find it a hard chapter                           585<br/>

To catch me with poetic rapture,<br/>

In which your mastery of art<br/>

Doth shew itself, and not your heart:<br/>

Nor will you raise in mine combustion<br/>

By dint of high heroic fustian.                               590<br/>

She that with poetry is won,<br/>

Is but a desk to write upon;<br/>

And what men say of her, they mean<br/>

No more than on the thing they lean.<br/>

Some with Arabian spices strive                               595<br/>

T' embalm her cruelly alive;<br/>

Or season her, as French cooks use<br/>

Their haut-gousts, bouillies, or ragousts:<br/>

Use her so barbarously ill,<br/>

To grind her lips upon a mill,                                600<br/>

Until the facet doublet doth<br/>

Fit their rhimes rather than her mouth:<br/>

Her mouth compar'd to an oyster's, with<br/>

A row of pearl in't — stead of teeth.<br/>

Others make posies of her cheeks,                             605<br/>

Where red and whitest colours mix;<br/>

In which the lily, and the rose,<br/>

For Indian lake and ceruse goes.<br/>

The sun and moon by her bright eyes<br/>

Eclips'd, and darken'd in the skies,                          610<br/>

Are but black patches, that she wears,<br/>

Cut into suns, and moons, and stars:<br/>

By which astrologers as well,<br/>

As those in Heav'n above, can tell<br/>

What strange events they do foreshow                          615<br/>

Unto her under-world below.<br/>

Her voice, the music of the spheres,<br/>

So loud, it deafens mortals ears;<br/>

As wise philosophers have thought;<br/>

And that's the cause we hear it not.                          620<br/>

This has been done by some, who those<br/>

Th' ador'd in rhime, would kick in prose;<br/>

And in those ribbons would have hung<br/>

On which melodiously they sung;<br/>

That have the hard fate to write best                         625<br/>

Of those still that deserve it least;<br/>

It matters not how false, or forc'd:<br/>

So the best things be said o' th' worst:<br/>

It goes for nothing when 'tis said;<br/>

Only the arrow's drawn to th' bead,                           630<br/>

Whether it be a swan or goose<br/>

They level at: So shepherds use<br/>

To set the same mark on the hip<br/>

Both of their sound and rotten sheep:<br/>

For wits, that carry low or wide,                             635<br/>

Must be aim'd higher, or beside<br/>

The mark, which else they ne'er come nigh,<br/>

But when they take their aim awry.<br/>

But I do wonder you should choose<br/>

This way t' attack me with your Muse,                         640<br/>

As one cut out to pass your tricks on,<br/>

With fulhams of poetic fiction:<br/>

I rather hop'd I should no more<br/>

Hear from you o' th' gallanting score:<br/>

For hard dry-bastings us'd to prove                           645<br/>

The readiest remedies of love;<br/>

Next a dry-diet: but if those fail,<br/>

Yet this uneasy loop-hol'd jail,<br/>

In which ye are hamper'd by the fetlock,<br/>

Cannot but put y' in mind of wedlock;                         650<br/>

Wedlock, that's worse than any hole here,<br/>

If that may serve you for a cooler,<br/>

T' allay your mettle, all agog<br/>

Upon a wife, the heavi'r clog:<br/>

Or rather thank your gentler fate,                            655<br/>

That for a bruis'd or broken pate,<br/>

Has freed you from those knobs that grow<br/>

Much harder on the marry'd brow:<br/>

But if no dread can cool your courage,<br/>

From vent'ring on that dragon, marriage,                      660<br/>

Yet give me quarter, and advance<br/>

To nobler aims your puissance:<br/>

Level at beauty and at wit;<br/>

The fairest mark is easiest hit.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00273">Quoth HUDIBRAS, I'm beforehand                                665<br/>

In that already, with your command<br/>

For where does beauty and high wit<br/>

But in your constellation meet?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00274">Quoth she, What does a match imply,<br/>

But likeness and equality?                                    670<br/>

I know you cannot think me fit<br/>

To be th' yoke-fellow of your wit;<br/>

Nor take one of so mean deserts,<br/>

To be the partner of your parts;<br/>

A grace which, if I cou'd believe,                            675<br/>

I've not the conscience to receive.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00275">That conscience, quoth HUDIBRAS,<br/>

Is mis-inform'd: I'll state the case<br/>

A man may be a legal donor,<br/>

Of any thing whereof he's owner,                              680<br/>

And may confer it where he lists,<br/>

I' th' judgment of all casuists,<br/>

Then wit, and parts, and valour, may<br/>

Be ali'nated, and made away,<br/>

By those that are proprietors,                                685<br/>

As I may give or sell my horse.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00276">Quoth she, I grant the case is true<br/>

And proper 'twixt your horse and you;<br/>

But whether I may take as well<br/>

As you may give away or sell?                                 690<br/>

Buyers you know are bid beware;<br/>

And worse than thieves receivers are.<br/>

How shall I answer hue and cry,<br/>

For a roan gelding, twelve hands high,<br/>

All spurr'd and switch'd, a lock on's hoof,                   695<br/>

A sorrel mane? Can I bring proof<br/>

Where, when, by whom, and what y' were sold for,<br/>

And in the open market toll'd for?<br/>

Or should I take you for a stray,<br/>

You must be kept a year and day                               700<br/>

(Ere I can own you) here i' the pound,<br/>

Where, if y' are sought, you may be found<br/>

And in the mean time I must pay<br/>

For all your provender and hay.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00277">Quoth he, It stands me much upon                              705<br/>

T' enervate this objection,<br/>

And prove myself; by topic clear<br/>

No gelding, as you would infer.<br/>

Loss of virility's averr'd<br/>

To be the cause of loss of beard,                             710<br/>

That does (like embryo in the womb)<br/>

Abortive on the chin become.<br/>

This first a woman did invent,<br/>

In envy of man's ornament;<br/>

SEMIRAMIS, of Babylon,                                        715<br/>

Who first of all cut men o' th' stone,<br/>

To mar their beards, and lay foundation<br/>

Of sow-geldering operation.<br/>

Look on this beard, and tell me whether<br/>

Eunuchs wear such, or geldings either?                        720<br/>

Next it appears I am no horse;<br/>

That I can argue and discourse<br/>

Have but two legs, and ne'er a tail.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00278">Quoth she, That nothing will avail<br/>

For some philosophers of late here,                           725<br/>

Write, men have four legs by nature,<br/>

And that 'tis custom makes them go<br/>

Erron'ously upon but two;<br/>

As 'twas in Germany made good<br/>

B' a boy that lost himself in a wood,                         730<br/>

And growing down to a man, was wont<br/>

With wolves upon all four to hunt.<br/>

As for your reasons drawn from tails,<br/>

We cannot say they're true or false,<br/>

Till you explain yourself, and show,                          735<br/>

B' experiment, 'tis so or no.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00279">Quoth he, If you'll join issue on't,<br/>

I'll give you satisfactory account;<br/>

So you will promise, if you lose,<br/>

To settle all, and be my spouse.                              740<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00280">That never shall be done (quoth she)<br/>

To one that wants a tail, by me<br/>

For tails by nature sure were meant,<br/>

As well as beards, for ornament:<br/>

And though the vulgar count them homely,                      745<br/>

In men or beast they are so comely,<br/>

So gentee, alamode, and handsome,<br/>

I'll never marry man that wants one;<br/>

And till you can demonstrate plain,<br/>

You have one equal to your mane,                              750<br/>

I'll be torn piece-meal by a horse,<br/>

Ere I'll take you for better or worse.<br/>

The Prince of CAMBAY's daily food<br/>

Is asp, and basilisk, and toad;<br/>

Which makes him have so strong a breath,                      755<br/>

Each night he stinks a queen to death;<br/>

Yet I shall rather lie in's arms<br/>

Than yours, on any other terms.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00281">Quoth he, What nature can afford,<br/>

I shall produce, upon my word;                                760<br/>

And if she ever gave that boon<br/>

To man, I'll prove that I have one<br/>

I mean by postulate illation,<br/>

When you shall offer just occasion:<br/>

But since y' have yet deny'd to give                          765<br/>

My heart, your pris'ner, a reprieve,<br/>

But made it sink down to my heel,<br/>

Let that at least your pity feel;<br/>

And, for the sufferings of your martyr,<br/>

Give its poor entertainer quarter;                            770<br/>

And, by discharge or main-prize, grant<br/>

Deliv'ry from this base restraint.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00282">Quoth she, I grieve to see your leg<br/>

Stuck in a hole here like a peg;<br/>

And if I knew which way to do't                               775<br/>

(Your honour safe) I'd let you out.<br/>

That Dames by jail-delivery<br/>

Of Errant-Knights have been set free,<br/>

When by enchantment they have been,<br/>

And sometimes for it too, laid in,                            780<br/>

Is that which Knights are bound to do<br/>

By order, oath, and honour too:<br/>

For what are they renown'd, and famous else,<br/>

But aiding of distressed damosels?<br/>

But for a Lady no ways errant,                                785<br/>

To free a Knight, we have no warrant<br/>

In any authentical romance,<br/>

Or classic author, yet of France;<br/>

And I'd be loth to have you break<br/>

An ancient custom for a freak,                                790<br/>

Or innovation introduce<br/>

In place of things of antique use;<br/>

To free your heels by any course,<br/>

That might b' unwholesome to your spurs;<br/>

Which, if I should consent unto,                              795<br/>

It is not in my pow'r to do;<br/>

For 'tis a service must be done ye<br/>

With solemn previous ceremony;<br/>

Which always has been us'd t' untie<br/>

The charms of those who here do lie                           800<br/>

For as the ancients heretofore<br/>

To Honour's Temple had no door,<br/>

But that which thorough Virtue's lay,<br/>

So from this dungeon there's no way<br/>

To honour'd freedom, but by passing                           805<br/>

That other virtuous school of lashing,<br/>

Where Knights are kept in narrow lists,<br/>

With wooden lockets 'bout their wrists;<br/>

In which they for a while are tenants,<br/>

And for their Ladies suffer penance:                          810<br/>

Whipping, that's Virtue's governess,<br/>

Tutress of arts and sciences;<br/>

That mends the gross mistakes of Nature,<br/>

And puts new life into dull matter;<br/>

That lays foundation for renown,                              815<br/>

And all the honours of the gown.<br/>

This suffer'd, they are set at large,<br/>

And freed with hon'rable discharge.<br/>

Then in their robes the penitentials<br/>

Are straight presented with credentials,                      820<br/>

And in their way attended on<br/>

By magistrates of ev'ry town;<br/>

And, all respect and charges paid,<br/>

They're to their ancient seats convey'd.<br/>

Now if you'll venture, for my sake,                           825<br/>

To try the toughness of your back,<br/>

And suffer (as the rest have done)<br/>

The laying of a whipping on,<br/>

(And may you prosper in your suit,<br/>

As you with equal vigour do't,)                               830<br/>

I here engage myself to loose ye,<br/>

And free your heels from Caperdewsie.<br/>

But since our sex's modesty<br/>

Will not allow I should be by,<br/>

Bring me, on oath, a fair account,                            835<br/>

And honour too, when you have done't,<br/>

And I'll admit you to the place<br/>

You claim as due in my good grace.<br/>

If matrimony and hanging go<br/>

By dest'ny, why not whipping too?                             840<br/>

What med'cine else can cure the fits<br/>

Of lovers when they lose their wits?<br/>

Love is a boy by poets stil'd;<br/>

Then spare the rod and spoil the child.<br/>

A Persian emp'ror whipp'd his grannam                         845<br/>

The sea, his mother VENUS came on;<br/>

And hence some rev'rend men approve<br/>

Of rosemary in making love.<br/>

As skilful coopers hoop their tubs<br/>

With Lydian and with Phrygian dubs,                           850<br/>

Why may not whipping have as good<br/>

A grace, perform'd in time and mood,<br/>

With comely movement, and by art,<br/>

Raise passion in a lady's heart?<br/>

It is an easier way to make                                   855<br/>

Love by, than that which many take.<br/>

Who would not rather suffer whipping,<br/>

Than swallow toasts of bits of ribbon?<br/>

Make wicked verses, treats, and faces,<br/>

And spell names over with beer-glasses                        860<br/>

Be under vows to hang and die<br/>

Love's sacrifice, and all a lie?<br/>

With china-oranges and tarts<br/>

And whinning plays, lay baits for hearts?<br/>

Bribe chamber-maids with love and money,                      865<br/>

To break no roguish jests upon ye?<br/>

For lilies limn'd on cheeks, and roses,<br/>

With painted perfumes, hazard noses?<br/>

Or, vent'ring to be brisk and wanton,<br/>

Do penance in a paper lanthorn?                               870<br/>

All this you may compound for now,<br/>

By suffering what I offer you;<br/>

Which is no more than has been done<br/>

By Knights for Ladies long agone.<br/>

Did not the great LA MANCHA do so                             875<br/>

For the INFANTA DEL TOBOSO?<br/>

Did not th' illustrious Bassa make<br/>

Himself a slave for Misse's sake?<br/>

And with bull's pizzle, for her love,<br/>

Was taw 'd as gentle as a glove?                              880<br/>

Was not young FLORIO sent (to cool<br/>

His flame for BIANCAFIORE) to school,<br/>

Where pedant made his pathic bum<br/>

For her sake suffer martyrdom?<br/>

Did not a certain lady whip                                   885<br/>

Of late her husband's own Lordship?<br/>

And though a grandee of the House,<br/>

Claw'd him with fundamental blows<br/>

Ty'd him stark naked to a bed-post,<br/>

And firk'd his hide, as if sh' had rid post                   890<br/>

And after, in the sessions-court,<br/>

Where whipping's judg'd, had honour for't?<br/>

This swear you will perform, and then<br/>

I'll set you from th' inchanted den,<br/>

And the magician's circle clear.                              895<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00283">Quoth he, I do profess and swear,<br/>

And will perform what you enjoin,<br/>

Or may I never see you mine.<br/>

Amen, (quoth she;) then turn'd about,<br/>

And bid her Esquire let him out.                              900<br/>

But ere an artist could be found<br/>

T' undo the charms another bound,<br/>

The sun grew low, and left the skies,<br/>

Put down (some write) by ladies eyes,<br/>

The moon pull'd off her veil of light                         905<br/>

That hides her face by day from sight,<br/>

(Mysterious veil, of brightness made,<br/>

That's both her lustre and her shade,)<br/>

And in the lanthorn of the night<br/>

With shining horns hung out her light;                        910<br/>

For darkness is the proper sphere,<br/>

Where all false glories use t' appear.<br/>

The twinkling stars began to muster,<br/>

And glitter with their borrow'd lustre,<br/>

While sleep the weary 'd world reliev'd,                      915<br/>

By counterfeiting death reviv'd;<br/>

His whipping penance till the morn<br/>

Our vot'ry thought it best t' adjourn,<br/>

And not to carry on a work<br/>

Of such importance in the dark,                               920<br/>

With erring haste, but rather stay,<br/>

And do't in th' open face of day;<br/>

And in the mean time go in quest<br/>

Of next retreat to take his rest.<br/>
