<p id="id00287" style="margin-top: 2em">'Tis strange how some mens' tempers suit<br/>

(Like bawd and brandy) with dispute,<br/>

That for their own opinions stand last<br/>

Only to have them claw'd and canvast;<br/>

That keep their consciences in cases,                           5<br/>

As fiddlers do their crowds and bases,<br/>

Ne'er to be us'd, but when they're bent<br/>

To play a fit for argument;<br/>

Make true and false, unjust and just,<br/>

Of no use but to be discust;                                   10<br/>

Dispute, and set a paradox<br/>

Like a straight boot upon the stocks,<br/>

And stretch it more unmercifully<br/>

Than HELMONT, MONTAIGN, WHITE, or TULLY,<br/>

So th' ancient &lt;n&gt; Stoicks, in their porch,                    15<br/>

With fierce dispute maintain'd their church;<br/>

Beat out their brains in fight and study,<br/>

To prove that Virtue is a Body;<br/>

That &lt;o&gt; Bonum is an Animal,<br/>

Made good with stout polemic brawl;                            20<br/>

in which some hundreds on the place<br/>

Were slain outright; and many a face<br/>

Retrench'd of nose, and eyes, and beard,<br/>

To maintain what their sect averr'd;<br/>

All which the Knight and Squire, in wrath,                     25<br/>

Had like t' have suffered for their faith,<br/>

Each striving to make good his own,<br/>

As by the sequel shall be shown.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00288">The Sun had long since, in the lap<br/>

Of THETIS, taken out his nap,                                  30<br/>

And, like a lobster boil'd, the morn<br/>

From black to red began to turn,<br/>

When HUDIBRAS, whom thoughts and aking,<br/>

'Twixt sleeping kept all night and waking,<br/>

Began to rub his drowsy eyes,                                  35<br/>

And from his couch prepar'd to rise,<br/>

Resolving to dispatch the deed<br/>

He vow'd to do with trusty speed.<br/>

But first, with knocking loud, and bawling,<br/>

He rouz'd the Squire, in truckle lolling;                      40<br/>

And, after many circumstances,<br/>

Which vulgar authors, in romances,<br/>

Do use to spend their time and wits on,<br/>

To make impertinent description,<br/>

They got (with much ado) to horse,                             45<br/>

And to the Castle bent their course,<br/>

In which he to the Dame before<br/>

To suffer whipping duly swore;<br/>

Where now arriv'd, and half unharnest,<br/>

To carry on the work in earnest,                               50<br/>

He stopp'd, and paus'd upon the sudden,<br/>

And with a serious forehead plodding,<br/>

Sprung a new scruple his head,<br/>

Which first he scratch'd, and after said â€”<br/>

Whether it be direct infringing                                55<br/>

An oath, if I should wave this swingeing,<br/>

And what I've sworn to bear, forbear,<br/>

And so b' equivocation swear,<br/>

Or whether it be a lesser sin<br/>

To be forsworn than act the thing,                             60<br/>

Are deep and subtle points, which must,<br/>

T' inform my conscience, be discust;<br/>

In which to err a tittle may<br/>

To errors infinite make way;<br/>

And therefore I desire to know                                 65<br/>

Thy judgment e'er we further go.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00289">Quoth Ralpho, Since you do enjoin't,<br/>

I shall enlarge upon the point;<br/>

And, for my own part, do not doubt<br/>

Th' affirmative may be made out,                               70<br/>

But first, to state the case aright,<br/>

For best advantage of our light,<br/>

And thus 'tis: Whether 't be a sin<br/>

To claw and curry your own skin,<br/>

Greater or less, than to forbear,                              75<br/>

And that you are forsworn, forswear.<br/>

But first, o' th' first: The inward man,<br/>

And outward, like a clan and clan,<br/>

Have always been at daggers-drawing,<br/>

And one another clapper-clawing.                               80<br/>

Not that they really cuff, or fence,<br/>

But in a Spiritual Mystick sense;<br/>

Which to mistake, and make 'em squabble<br/>

In literal fray's abominable.<br/>

'Tis heathenish, in frequent use                               85<br/>

With Pagans and apostate Jews,<br/>

To offer sacrifice of bridewells,<br/>

Like modern Indians to their idols;<br/>

And mongrel Christians of our times,<br/>

That expiate less with greater crimes,                         90<br/>

And call the foul abomination,<br/>

Contrition and mortification.<br/>

Is 't not enough we're bruis'd and kicked<br/>

With sinful members of the wicked,<br/>

Our vessels, that are sanctify'd,                              95<br/>

Prophan'd and curry'd back and side,<br/>

But we must claw ourselves with shameful<br/>

And heathen stripes, by their example;<br/>

Which (were there nothing to forbid it)<br/>

Is impious because they did it;                               100<br/>

This, therefore, may be justly reckon'd<br/>

A heinous sin. Now to the second<br/>

That Saints may claim a dispensation<br/>

To swear and forswear, on occasion,<br/>

I doubt not but it will appear                                105<br/>

With pregnant light: the point is clear.<br/>

Oaths are but words, and words but wind;<br/>

Too feeble implements to bind;<br/>

And hold with deeds proportion so<br/>

As shadows to a substance do.                                 110<br/>

Then when they strive for place, 'tis fit<br/>

The weaker vessel should submit.<br/>

Although your Church be opposite<br/>

To ours as Black Friars are to White,<br/>

In rule and order, yet I grant,                               115<br/>

You are a Reformado Saint;<br/>

And what the Saints do claim as due,<br/>

You may pretend a title to:<br/>

But Saints whom oaths and vows oblige,<br/>

Know little of their privilege;                               120<br/>

Further (I mean) than carrying on<br/>

Some self-advantage of their own:<br/>

For if the Dev'l, to serve his turn,<br/>

Can tell troth, why the Saints should scorn,<br/>

When it serves theirs, to swear and lye;                      125<br/>

I think there's little reason why:<br/>

Else h' has a greater pow'r than they,<br/>

Which 't were impiety to say.<br/>

W' are not commanded to forbear<br/>

Indefinitely at all to swear;                                 130<br/>

But to swear idly, and in vain,<br/>

Without self-interest or gain<br/>

For breaking of an oath, and lying,<br/>

Is but a kind of self-denying;<br/>

A Saint-like virtue: and from hence                           135<br/>

Some have broke oaths by Providence<br/>

Some, to the glory of the Lord,<br/>

Perjur'd themselves, and broke their word;<br/>

And this the constant rule and practice<br/>

Of all our late Apostles acts is.                             140<br/>

Was not the cause at first begun<br/>

With perjury, and carried on?<br/>

Was there an oath the Godly took,<br/>

But in due time and place they broke?<br/>

Did we not bring our oaths in first,                          145<br/>

Before our plate, to have them burst,<br/>

And cast in fitter models for<br/>

The present use of Church and War?<br/>

Did not our Worthies of the House,<br/>

Before they broke the peace, break vows?                      150<br/>

For having freed us first from both<br/>

Th' Allegiance and Supremacy Oath,<br/>

Did they not next compel the Nation<br/>

To take and break the Protestation?<br/>

To swear, and after to recant                                 155<br/>

The solemn League and Covenant?<br/>

To take th' Engagement, and disclaim it,<br/>

Enforc'd by those who first did frame it<br/>

Did they not swear, at first, to fight<br/>

For the KING'S Safety and his Right,                          160<br/>

And after march'd to find him out,<br/>

And charg'd him home with horse and foot;<br/>

But yet still had the confidence<br/>

To swear it was in his defence<br/>

Did they not swear to live and die                            165<br/>

With Essex, and straight laid him by?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00290">If that were all, for some have swore<br/>

As false as they, if th' did no more,<br/>

Did they not swear to maintain Law,<br/>

In which that swearing made a flaw?                           170<br/>

For Protestant Religion vow,<br/>

That did that vowing disallow?<br/>

For Privilege of Parliament,<br/>

In which that swearing made a rent?<br/>

And since, of all the three, not one                          175<br/>

Is left in being, 'tis well known.<br/>

Did they not swear, in express words,<br/>

To prop and back the House of Lords,<br/>

And after turn'd out the whole House-full<br/>

Of Peers, as dang'rous and unusefull?                         180<br/>

So CROMWELL, with deep oaths and vows,<br/>

Swore all the Commons out o' th' House;<br/>

Vow'd that the red-coats would disband,<br/>

Ay, marry wou'd they, at their command;<br/>

And troll'd them on, and swore, and swore,                    185<br/>

Till th' army turn'd them out of door.<br/>

This tells us plainly what they thought,<br/>

That oaths and swearing go for nought,<br/>

And that by them th' were only meant<br/>

To serve for an expedient.                                    190<br/>

What was the Public Faith found out for,<br/>

But to slur men of what they fought for<br/>

The Public Faith, which ev'ry one<br/>

Is bound t' observe, yet kept by none;<br/>

And if that go for nothing, why                               195<br/>

Should Private Faith have such a tye?<br/>

Oaths were not purpos'd more than law,<br/>

To keep the good and just in awe,<br/>

But to confine the bad and sinful,<br/>

Like moral cattle, in a pinfold.                              200<br/>

A Saint's of th' Heav'nly Realm a Peer;<br/>

And as no Peer is bound to swear,<br/>

But on the Gospel of his Honour,<br/>

Of which he may dispose as owner,<br/>

It follows, though the thing be forgery,                      205<br/>

And false th' affirm, it is no perjury,<br/>

But a mere ceremony, and a breach<br/>

Of nothing, but a form of speech;<br/>

And goes for no more when 'tis took,<br/>

Than mere saluting of the book.                               210<br/>

Suppose the Scriptures are of force,<br/>

They're but commissions of course,<br/>

And Saints have freedom to digress,<br/>

And vary from 'em, as they please;<br/>

Or mis-interpret them, by private                             215<br/>

Instructions, to all aims they drive at.<br/>

Then why should we ourselves abridge<br/>

And curtail our own privilege?<br/>

Quakers (that, like to lanthorns, bear<br/>

Their light within 'em) will not swear                        220<br/>

Their gospel is an accidence,<br/>

By which they construe conscience,<br/>

And hold no sin so deeply red,<br/>

As that of breaking Priscian's head;<br/>

(The head and founder of their order,)                        225<br/>

That stirring Hat's held worse than murder.<br/>

These thinking th' are oblig'd to troth<br/>

In swearing, will not take an oath<br/>

Like mules, who, if th' have not their will<br/>

To keep their own pace, stand stock-still:                    230<br/>

But they are weak, and little know<br/>

What free-born consciences may do.<br/>

'Tis the temptation of the Devil<br/>

That makes all human actions evil<br/>

For Saints may do the same things by                          235<br/>

The Spirit, in sincerity,<br/>

Which other men are tempted to,<br/>

And at the Devil's instance do<br/>

And yet the actions be contrary,<br/>

Just as the Saints and Wicked vary.                           240<br/>

For as on land there is no beast,<br/>

But in some fish at sea's exprest,<br/>

So in the Wicked there's no Vice,<br/>

Of which the Saints have not a spice;<br/>

And yet that thing that's pious in                            245<br/>

The one, in th' other is a sin.<br/>

Is't not ridiculous, and nonsense,<br/>

A Saint should be a slave to conscience,<br/>

That ought to be above such fancies,<br/>

As far as above ordinances?                                   250<br/>

She's of the wicked, as I guess,<br/>

B' her looks, her language, and her dress:<br/>

And though, like constables, we search,<br/>

For false wares, one another's Church,<br/>

Yet all of us hold this for true,                             255<br/>

No Faith is to the wicked due;<br/>

For truth is precious and divine;<br/>

Too rich a pearl for carnal swine,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00291">Quoth HUDIBRAS, All this is true;                             260<br/>

Yet 'tis not fit that all men knew,<br/>

Those mysteries and revelations,<br/>

And therefore topical evasions<br/>

Of subtle turns and shifts of sense,<br/>

Serve best with th' wicked for pretence,<br/>

Such as the learned Jesuits use,                              265<br/>

And Presbyterians for excuse<br/>

Against the Protestants, when th' happen<br/>

To find their Churches taken napping:<br/>

As thus: A breach of oath is duple,<br/>

And either way admits a scruple,                              270<br/>

And may be, ex parte of the maker<br/>

More criminal than th' injur'd taker;<br/>

For he that strains too far a vow,<br/>

Will break it, like an o'er-bent bow:<br/>

And he that made, and forc'd it, broke it,                    275<br/>

Not he that for convenience took it.<br/>

A broken oath is, quatenus oath,<br/>

As sound t' all purposes of troth,<br/>

As broken laws are ne'er the worse;<br/>

Nay, till th' are broken have no force.                       280<br/>

What's justice to a man, or laws,<br/>

That never comes within their claws<br/>

They have no pow'r, but to admonish:<br/>

Cannot controul, coerce, or punish,<br/>

Until they're broken, and then touch                          285<br/>

Those only that do make 'em such.<br/>

Beside, no engagement is allow'd<br/>

By men in prison made for good;<br/>

For when they're set at liberty,<br/>

They're from th' engagement too set free.                     290<br/>

The rabbins write, when any Jew<br/>

Did make to God, or man, a vow,<br/>

Which afterward he found untoward,<br/>

And stubborn to be kept, or too hard,<br/>

Any three other Jews o' th' nation,                           295<br/>

Might free him from the obligation<br/>

And have not two saints pow'r to use<br/>

A greater privilege than three Jews?<br/>

The court of conscience, which in man<br/>

Should be supreme and sovereign,                              300<br/>

Is't fit should be subordinate<br/>

To ev'ry petty court i' the state,<br/>

And have less power than the lesser,<br/>

To deal with perjury at pleasure?<br/>

Have its proceedings disallow'd, or                           305<br/>

Allow'd, at fancy of Pye-Powder?<br/>

Tell all it does, or does not know,<br/>

For swearing ex officio?<br/>

Be forc'd t' impeach a broken hedge,<br/>

And pigs unring'd at Vis. Franc. Pledge?                      310<br/>

Discover thieves, and bawds, recusants,<br/>

Priests, witches, eves-droppers, and nuisance:<br/>

Tell who did play at games unlawful,<br/>

And who fill'd pots of ale but half-full<br/>

And have no pow'r at all, nor shift,                          315<br/>

To help itself at a dead lift<br/>

Why should not conscience have vacation<br/>

As well as other courts o' th' nation<br/>

Have equal power to adjourn,<br/>

Appoint appearance and return;                                320<br/>

And make as nice distinction serve<br/>

To split a case, as those that carve,<br/>

Invoking cuckolds' names, hit joints;<br/>

Why should not tricks as slight do points<br/>

Is not th' High-Court of Justice sworn                        325<br/>

To judge that law that serves their turn,<br/>

Make their own jealousies high-treason,<br/>

And fix 'm whomsoe'er they please on?<br/>

Cannot the learned counsel there<br/>

Make laws in any shape appear?                                330<br/>

Mould 'em as witches do their clay,<br/>

When they make pictures to destroy<br/>

And vex 'em into any form<br/>

That fits their purpose to do harm?<br/>

Rack 'em until they do confess,                               335<br/>

Impeach of treason whom they please,<br/>

And most perfidiously condemn<br/>

Those that engag'd their lives for them?<br/>

And yet do nothing in their own sense,<br/>

But what they ought by oath and conscience?                   340<br/>

Can they not juggle, and, with slight<br/>

Conveyance, play with wrong and right;<br/>

And sell their blasts of wind as dear<br/>

As Lapland witches bottled air?<br/>

Will not fear, favour, bribe and grudge                       345<br/>

The same case sev'ral ways adjudge?<br/>

As seamen, with the self-same gale,<br/>

Will sev'ral different courses sail?<br/>

As when the sea breaks o'er its bounds,<br/>

And overflows the level grounds,                              350<br/>

Those banks and dams, that, like a screen,<br/>

Did keep it out, now keep it in;<br/>

So when tyrannic usurpation<br/>

Invades the freedom of a nation,<br/>

The laws o' th' land, that were intended                      355<br/>

To keep it out, are made defend it.<br/>

Does not in chanc'ry ev'ry man swear<br/>

What makes best for him in his answer?<br/>

Is not the winding up witnesses<br/>

And nicking more than half the bus'ness?                      360<br/>

For witnesses, like watches, go<br/>

Just as they're set, too fast or slow;<br/>

And where in conscience they're strait-lac'd,<br/>

'Tis ten to one that side is cast.<br/>

Do not your juries give their verdict                         365<br/>

As if they felt the cause, not heard it?<br/>

And as they please, make matter of fact<br/>

Run all on one side, as they're pack't?<br/>

Nature has made man's breast no windores,<br/>

To publish what he does within doors,                         370<br/>

Nor what dark secrets there inhabit,<br/>

Unless his own rash folly blab it.<br/>

If oaths can do a man no good<br/>

In his own bus'ness, why they shou'd<br/>

In other matters do him hurt,                                 375<br/>

I think there's little reason for't.<br/>

He that imposes an oath, makes it,<br/>

Not he that for convenience takes it:<br/>

Then how can any man be said<br/>

To break an oath he never made?                               380<br/>

These reasons may, perhaps, look oddly<br/>

To th' Wicked, though th' evince the Godly;<br/>

But if they will not serve to clear<br/>

My honour, I am ne'er the near.<br/>

Honour is like that glassy bubble                             385<br/>

That finds philosophers such trouble,<br/>

Whose least part crack't, the whole does fly,<br/>

And wits are crack'd to find out why.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00292">Quoth RALPHO, Honour's but a word<br/>

To swear by only in a Lord:                                   390<br/>

In other men 'tis but a huff,<br/>

To vapour with instead of proof;<br/>

That, like a wen, looks big and swells,<br/>

Is senseless, and just nothing else.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00293">Let it (quoth he) be what it will,                            395<br/>

It has the world's opinion still.<br/>

But as men are not wise that run<br/>

The slightest hazard they may shun,<br/>

There may a medium be found out<br/>

To clear to all the world the doubt;                          400<br/>

And that is, if a man may do't,<br/>

By proxy whipt, or substitute.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00294">Though nice and dark the point appear,<br/>

(Quoth RALPH) it may hold up and clear.<br/>

That sinners may supply the place                             405<br/>

Of suff'ring Saints is a plain case.<br/>

Justice gives sentence many times<br/>

On one man for another's crimes.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00295">Our brethren of NEW ENGLAND use<br/>

Choice malefactors to excuse,                                 410<br/>

And hang the guiltless in their stead,<br/>

Of whom the Churches have less need;<br/>

As lately 't happen'd: In a town &lt;p&gt;<br/>

There liv'd a cobler, and but one,<br/>

That out of doctrine could cut use,                           415<br/>

And mend men's lives as well as shoes,<br/>

This precious brother having slain,<br/>

In time of peace, an Indian,<br/>

(Not out of malice, but mere zeal,<br/>

Because he was an Infidel,)                                   420<br/>

The mighty TOTTIPOTTYMOY<br/>

Sent to our elders an envoy,<br/>

Complaining sorely of the breach<br/>

Of league held forth by brother Patch<br/>

Against the articles in force                                 425<br/>

Between both Churches, his and ours<br/>

For which he crav'd the Saints to render<br/>

Into his hands or hang th' offender<br/>

But they maturely having weigh'd,<br/>

They had no more but him o' th' trade,                        430<br/>

(A man that serv'd them in a double<br/>

Capacity, to teach and cobble,)<br/>

Resolv'd to spare him; yet, to do<br/>

The Indian Hoghgan Moghgan too<br/>

Impartial justice, in his stead did                           435<br/>

Hang an old Weaver, that was bed-rid.<br/>

Then wherefore way not you be skipp'd,<br/>

And in your room another whipp'd?<br/>

For all Philosophers, but the Sceptick,<br/>

Hold whipping may be sympathetick.                            440<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00296">It is enough, quoth HUDIBRAS,<br/>

Thou hast resolv'd and clear'd the case<br/>

And canst, in conscience, not refuse<br/>

From thy own doctrine to raise use.<br/>

I know thou wilt not (for my sake)                            445<br/>

Be tender-conscienc'd of thy back.<br/>

Then strip thee off thy carnal jerking,<br/>

And give thy outward-fellow a ferking;<br/>

For when thy vessel is new hoop'd,<br/>

All leaks of sinning will be stopp'd.                         450<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00297">Quoth RALPHO, You mistake the matter;<br/>

For in all scruples of this nature,<br/>

No man includes himself, nor turns<br/>

The point upon his own concerns.<br/>

As no man of his own self catches                             455<br/>

The itch, or amorous French aches<br/>

So no man does himself convince,<br/>

By his own doctrine, of his sins<br/>

And though all cry down self, none means<br/>

His ownself in a literal sense.                               460<br/>

Beside, it is not only foppish,<br/>

But vile, idolatrous and Popish,<br/>

For one man, out of his own skin,<br/>

To ferk and whip another's sin;<br/>

As pedants out of school-boys' breeches                       465<br/>

Do claw and curry their own itches.<br/>

But in this case it is prophane,<br/>

And sinful too, because in vain;<br/>

For we must take our oaths upon it,<br/>

You did the deed, when I have done it.                        470<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00298">Quoth HUDIBRAS, That's answer'd soon<br/>

Give us the whip, we'll lay it on.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00299">Quoth RALPHO, That we may swear true,<br/>

'Twere properer that I whipp'd you<br/>

For when with your consent 'tis done,                         475<br/>

The act is really your own.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00300">Quoth HUDIBRAS, It is in vain<br/>

(I see) to argue 'gainst the grain;<br/>

Or, like the stars, incline men to<br/>

What they're averse themselves to do:                         480<br/>

For when disputes are weary'd out,<br/>

'Tis interest still resolves the doubt<br/>

But since no reason can confute ye,<br/>

I'll try to force you to your duty<br/>

For so it is, howe'er you mince it;                           485<br/>

As ere we part, I shall evince it<br/>

And curry (if you stand out) whether<br/>

You will or no, your stubborn leather.<br/>

Canst thou refuse to hear thy part<br/>

I' th' publick work, base as thou art?                        490<br/>

To higgle thus for a few blows,<br/>

To gain thy Knight an op'lent spouse<br/>

Whose wealth his bowels yearn to purchase,<br/>

Merely for th' interest of the Churches;<br/>

And when he has it in his claws,                              495<br/>

Will not be hide-bound to the Cause?<br/>

Nor shalt thou find him a Curmudgin,<br/>

If thou dispatch it without grudging.<br/>

If not, resolve, before we go,<br/>

That you and I must pull a crow.                              500<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00301">Y' had best (quoth RALPHO) as the ancients<br/>

Say wisely, Have a care o' th' main chance,<br/>

And look before you ere you leap;<br/>

For as you sow, y' are like to reap:<br/>

And were y' as good as George-a-Green,                        505<br/>

I shall make bold to turn agen<br/>

Nor am I doubtful of the issue<br/>

In a just quarrel, and mine is so.<br/>

Is't fitting for a man of honour<br/>

To whip the Saints, like Bishop Bonner?                       510<br/>

A Knight t' usurp the beadle's office,<br/>

For which y' are like to raise brave trophies.<br/>

But I advise you (not for fear,<br/>

But for your own sake) to forbear;<br/>

And for the Churches, which may chance,                       515<br/>

From hence, to spring a variance;<br/>

And raise among themselves new scruples,<br/>

Whom common danger hardly couples.<br/>

Remember how, in arms and politicks,<br/>

We still have worsted all your holy tricks;                   520<br/>

Trepann'd your party with intrigue,<br/>

And took your grandees down a peg;<br/>

New modell'd th' army, and cashier'd<br/>

All that to legion SMEC adher'd;<br/>

Made a mere utensil o' your Church,                           525<br/>

And after left it in the lurch<br/>

A scaffold to build up our own,<br/>

And, when w' had done with't, pull'd it down<br/>

Capoch'd your Rabbins of the Synod,<br/>

And snap'd their Canons with a why-not;                       530<br/>

(Grave Synod Men, that were rever'd<br/>

For solid face and depth of beard;)<br/>

Their classic model prov'd a maggot,<br/>

Their direct'ry an Indian Pagod;<br/>

And drown'd their discipline like a kitten,                   535<br/>

On which they'd been so long a sitting;<br/>

Decry'd it as a holy cheat,<br/>

Grown out of date, and obsolete;<br/>

And all the Saints of the first grass<br/>

As casting foals of Balaam's ass.                             540<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00302">At this the Knight grew high in chafe,<br/>

And staring furiously on RALPH,<br/>

He trembled, and look'd pale with ire<br/>

Like ashes first, then red as fire.<br/>

Have I (quoth he) been ta'en in fight,                        545<br/>

And for so many moons lain by't,<br/>

And, when all other means did fail,<br/>

&lt;q&gt; Have been exchang'd for tubs of ale?<br/>

Not but they thought me worth a ransome<br/>

Much more consid'rable and handsome,                          550<br/>

But for their own sakes, and for fear<br/>

They were not safe when I was there<br/>

Now to be baffled by a scoundrel,<br/>

An upstart sect'ry, and a mungrel;<br/>

Such as breed out of peccant humours,                         555<br/>

Of our own Church, like wens or tumours,<br/>

And, like a maggot in a sore,<br/>

Would that which gave it life devour;<br/>

It never shall be done or said;<br/>

With that he seiz'd upon his blade;                           560<br/>

And RALPHO too, as quick and bold,<br/>

Upon his basket-hilt laid hold,<br/>

With equal readiness prcpar'd<br/>

To draw, and stand upon his guard;<br/>

When both were parted on the sudden,                          565<br/>

 With hideous clamour, and a loud one<br/>

As if all sorts of noise had been<br/>

Contracted into one loud din;<br/>

Or that some member to be chosen,<br/>

Had got the odds above a thousand,                            570<br/>

And by the greatness of its noise,<br/>

Prov'd fittest for his country's choice.<br/>

This strange surprisal put the Knight<br/>

And wrathful Squire into a fright;<br/>

And though they stood prepar'd, with fatal                    575<br/>

Impetuous rancour to join battel,<br/>

Both thought it was the wisest course<br/>

To wave the fight and mount to horse,<br/>

And to secure by swift retreating,<br/>

Themselves from danger of worse beating.                      580<br/>

Yet neither of them would disparage,<br/>

By utt'ring of his mind, his courage,<br/>

Which made them stoutly keep their ground,<br/>

With horror and disdain wind-bound.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00303">And now the cause of all their fear                           585<br/>

By slow degrees approach'd so near,<br/>

They might distinguish different noise<br/>

Of horns, and pans, and dogs, and boys,<br/>

And kettle-drums, whose sullen dub<br/>

Sounds like the hooping of a tub.                             590<br/>

But when the sight appear'd in view,<br/>

They found it was an antique show;<br/>

A triumph, that, for pomp and state,<br/>

Did proudest Romans emulate:<br/>

For as the aldermen of Rome                                   595<br/>

Their foes at training overcome,<br/>

And not enlarging territory,<br/>

(As some mistaken write in Story,)<br/>

Being mounted, in their best array,<br/>

Upon a carr, and who but they!                                600<br/>

And follow'd with a world of tall-lads,<br/>

That merry ditties troll'd, and ballads,<br/>

Did ride with many a good-morrow,<br/>

Crying, Hey for our Town! through the Borough<br/>

So when this triumph drew so nigh                             605<br/>

They might particulars descry,<br/>

They never saw two things so pat,<br/>

In all respects, as this and that.<br/>

First, he that led the cavalcade,<br/>

Wore a sow-gelder's flagellate,                               610<br/>

On which he blew as strong a levet<br/>

As well-fee'd lawyer on his breviate,<br/>

When over one another's heads<br/>

They charge (three ranks at once) like Swedes,<br/>

Next pans and kettle, of all keys,                            615<br/>

From trebles down to double base;<br/>

And after them, upon a nag,<br/>

That might pass for a forehand stag,<br/>

A cornet rode, and on his staff<br/>

A smock display'd did proudly wave.                           620<br/>

Then bagpipes of the loudest drones,<br/>

With snuffling broken-winded tones,<br/>

Whose blasts of air, in pockets shut<br/>

Sound filthier than from the gut,<br/>

And make a viler noise than swine                             625<br/>

In windy weather, when they whine.<br/>

Next one upon a pair of panniers,<br/>

Full fraught with that which for good manners<br/>

Shall here be nameless, mixt with grains,<br/>

Which he dispens'd among the swains,                          630<br/>

And busily upon the crowd<br/>

At random round about bestow'd.<br/>

Then, mounted on a horned horse,<br/>

One bore a gauntlet and gilt spurs,<br/>

Ty'd to the pummel of a long sword                            635<br/>

He held reverst, the point turn'd downward,<br/>

Next after, on a raw-bon'd steed,<br/>

The conqueror's standard-bearer rid,<br/>

And bore aloft before the champion<br/>

A petticoat display'd, and rampant                            640<br/>

Near whom the Amazon triumphant<br/>

Bestrid her beast, and on the rump on't<br/>

Sat face to tail, and bum to bum,<br/>

The warrior whilom overcome;<br/>

Arm'd with a spindle and a distaff,                           645<br/>

Which, as he rode, she made him twist off;<br/>

And when he loiter'd, o'er her shoulder<br/>

Chastis'd the reformado soldier.<br/>

Before the dame, and round about,<br/>

March'd whifflers and staffiers on foot,                      650<br/>

With lackies, grooms, valets, and pages,<br/>

In fit and proper equipages;<br/>

Of whom some torches bore, some links,<br/>

Before the proud virago minx,<br/>

That was both Madam and a Don,                                655<br/>

Like NERO'S SPORUS, or POPE JOAN;<br/>

And at fit periods the whole rout<br/>

Set up their throats with clamorous shout.<br/>

The Knight, transported, and the Squire,<br/>

Put up their weapons, and their ire;                          660<br/>

And HUDIBRAS, who us'd to ponder<br/>

On such sights with judicious wonder,<br/>

Could hold no longer to impart<br/>

His animadversions, for his heart.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00304">Quoth he, In all my life, till now,                           665<br/>

I ne'er saw so prophane a show.<br/>

It is a Paganish invention, â€”<br/>

Which heathen writers often mention:<br/>

And he who made it had read GOODWIN,<br/>

Or Ross, or CAELIUS RHODOGINE,                                670<br/>

With all the Grecians, SPEEDS and STOWS,<br/>

That best describe those ancient shows;<br/>

And has observ'd all fit decorums<br/>

We find describ'd by old historians:<br/>

For as the Roman conqueror,                                   675<br/>

That put an end to foreign war,<br/>

Ent'ring the town in triumph for it,<br/>

&lt;r&gt; Bore a slave with him, in his chariot;<br/>

So this insulting female brave,<br/>

Carries behind her here a slave:                              680<br/>

And as the ancients long ago,<br/>

When they in field defy'd the foe,<br/>

&lt;s&gt; Hung out their mantles della guerre,<br/>

So her proud standard-bearer here<br/>

Waves on his spear, in dreadful manner,                       685<br/>

A Tyrian-petticoat for banner:<br/>

&lt;t&gt; Next links and torches, heretofore<br/>

Still borne before the emperor.<br/>

And as, in antique triumphs, eggs<br/>

Were borne for mystical intrigues,                            690<br/>

There's one with truncheon, like a ladle,<br/>

That carries eggs too, fresh or addle;<br/>

And still at random, as he goes,<br/>

Among the rabble-rout bestows.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00305">Quoth Ralpho, You mistake the matter;                         695<br/>

For all th' antiquity you smatter,<br/>

Is but a riding, us'd of course<br/>

When the grey mare's the better horse;<br/>

When o'er the breeches greedy women<br/>

Fight to extend their vast dominion;                          700<br/>

And in the cause impatient Grizel<br/>

Has drubb'd her Husband with bull's pizzle,<br/>

And brought him under Covert-Baron,<br/>

To turn her vassal with a murrain;<br/>

When wives their sexes shift, like hares,                     705<br/>

And ride their husbands like night-mares,<br/>

And they in mortal battle vanquish'd,<br/>

Are of their charter disenfranchis'd<br/>

And by the right of war, like gills,<br/>

Condemn'd to distaff, horns, and wheels:                      710<br/>

For when men by their wives are cow'd,<br/>

Their horns of course are understood<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00306">Quoth HUDIBRAS thou still giv'st sentence<br/>

Impertinently, and against sense.<br/>

Tis not the least disparagement                               715<br/>

To be defeated by th' event,<br/>

Nor to be beaten by main force;<br/>

That does not make a man the worse,<br/>

Although his shoulders with battoon<br/>

Be claw'd and cudgel'd to some tune.                          720<br/>

A taylor's 'prentice has no hard<br/>

Measure that's bang'd with a true yard:<br/>

But to turn tail, or run away,<br/>

And without blows give up the day,<br/>

Or to surrender ere th' assault,                              725<br/>

That's no man's fortune, but his fault,<br/>

And renders men of honour less<br/>

Than all th' adversity of success;<br/>

And only unto such this shew<br/>

Of horns and petticoats is due.                               730<br/>

There is a lesser profanation,<br/>

Like that the Romans call'd ovation:<br/>

For as ovation was allow'd<br/>

For conquest purchas'd without blood,<br/>

So men decree these lesser shows                              735<br/>

For victory gotten without blows,<br/>

By dint of sharp hard words, which some<br/>

Give battle with, and overcome.<br/>

These mounted in a chair-curule,<br/>

Which moderns call a cucking-stool,                           740<br/>

March proudly to the river's side,<br/>

And o'er the waves in triumph ride;<br/>

Like Dukes of VENICE, who are said<br/>

The Adriatick Sea to wed;<br/>

And have a gentler wife than those                            745<br/>

For whom the State decrees those shows,<br/>

But both are heathenish, and come<br/>

From th' whores of Babylon and Rome;<br/>

And by the Saints should be withstood,<br/>

As Antichristian and lewd;                                    750<br/>

And as such, should now contribute<br/>

Our utmost struggling to prohibit.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00307">This said, they both advanc'd, and rode<br/>

A dog-trot through the bawling crowd,<br/>

T'attack the leader, and still prest,                         755<br/>

Till they approach'd him breast to breast<br/>

Then HUDIBRAS, with face and hand,<br/>

Made signs for silence; which obtain'd,<br/>

What means (quoth he) this Devil's precession<br/>

With men of orthodox profession?                              760<br/>

'Tis ethnic and idolatrous,<br/>

From heathenism deriv'd to us,<br/>

Does not the Whore of Babylon ride<br/>

Upon her horned beast astride<br/>

Like this proud dame, who either is                           765<br/>

A type of her, or she of this?<br/>

Are things of superstitious function<br/>

Fit to be us'd in Gospel Sun-shine?<br/>

It is an Antichristian opera,<br/>

Much us'd in midnight times of Popery,                        770<br/>

Of running after self-inventions<br/>

Of wicked and profane intentions;<br/>

To scandalize that sex for scolding,<br/>

To whom the Saints are so beholden.<br/>

Women, who were our first Apostles                            775<br/>

Without whose aid we had been lost else;<br/>

Women, that left no stone unturn'd<br/>

In which the Cause might he concern'd;<br/>

Brought in their children's' spoons and whistles,<br/>

To purchase swords, carbines, and pistols;                    780<br/>

Their husbands, cullies, and sweet-hearts,<br/>

To take the Saints and Churches' parts;<br/>

Drew several gifted Brethren in,<br/>

That for the Bishops would have been,<br/>

And fix'd 'em constant to the party,                          785<br/>

With motives powerful and hearty;<br/>

Their husbands robb'd, and made hard shifts<br/>

T'administer unto their gifts<br/>

All they cou'd rap, and rend, and pilfer,<br/>

To scraps and ends of gold and silver;                        790<br/>

Rubb'd down the Teachers, tir'd and spent<br/>

With holding forth for Parliament,<br/>

Pamper'd and edify'd their zeal<br/>

With marrow-puddings many a meal;<br/>

And led them, with store of meat,                             795<br/>

On controverted points to eat;<br/>

And cram'd 'em, till their guts did ake,<br/>

With cawdle, custard, and plum-cake:<br/>

What have they done, or what left undone,<br/>

That might advance the Cause at London?                       800<br/>

March'd rank and file, with drum and ensign,<br/>

T'intrench the city for defence in<br/>

Rais'd rampiers with their own soft hands,<br/>

To put the enemy to stands;<br/>

From ladies down to oyster-wenches,                           805<br/>

Labour'd like pioneers in trenches;<br/>

Fell to their pick-axes, and tools,<br/>

And help'd the men to dig like moles?<br/>

Have not the handmaids of the city<br/>

Chose of their members a committee,                           810<br/>

For raising of a common purse<br/>

Out of their wages to raise horse?<br/>

And do they not as triers sit,<br/>

To judge what officers are fit<br/>

Have they â€”? At that an egg let fly,                         815<br/>

Hit him directly o'er the eye,<br/>

And running down his cheek, besmear'd,<br/>

With orange tawny slime, his beard;<br/>

But beard and slime being of one hue,<br/>

The wound the less appear'd in view.                          820<br/>

Then he that on the panniers rode,<br/>

Let fly on th' other side a load,<br/>

And, quickly charg'd again, gave fully<br/>

In RALPHO'S face another volley.<br/>

The Knight was startled with the smell,                       825<br/>

And for his sword began to feel;<br/>

And RALPHO, smother'd with the stink,<br/>

Grasp'd his; when one, that bore a link,<br/>

O' th' sudden clapp'd his flaming cudgel,<br/>

Like linstock, to the horse's touch-hole;                     830<br/>

And straight another, with his flambeaux,<br/>

Gave RALPHO'S o'er the eye a damn'd blow.<br/>

The beasts began to kick and fling,<br/>

And forc'd the rout to make a ring,<br/>

Through which they quickly broke their way,                   835<br/>

And brought them off from further fray;<br/>

And though disorder'd in retreat,<br/>

Each of them stoutly kept his seat<br/>

For quitting both their swords and reins,<br/>

They grasp'd with all their strength the manes,               840<br/>

And, to avoid the foe's pursuit,<br/>

With spurring put their cattle to't;<br/>

And till all four were out of wind,<br/>

And danger too, ne'er look'd behind.<br/>

After th' had paus'd a while, supplying                       845<br/>

Their spirits, spent with fight and flying,<br/>

And HUDIBRAS recruited force<br/>

Of lungs, for action or discourse,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00308">Quoth he, That man is sure to lose<br/>

That fouls his hands with dirty foes:                         850<br/>

For where no honour's to be gain'd,<br/>

'Tis thrown away in b'ing maintain'd.<br/>

'Twas ill for us we had to do<br/>

With so dishonourable a foe:<br/>

For though the law of arms doth bar                           855<br/>

The use of venom'd shot in war,<br/>

Yet, by the nauseous smell, and noisome,<br/>

Their case-shot savours strong of poison;<br/>

And doubtless have been chew'd with teeth<br/>

Of some that had a stinking breath;                           860<br/>

Else, when we put it to the push,<br/>

They have not giv'n us such a brush.<br/>

But as those pultroons, that fling dirt,<br/>

Do but defile, but cannot hurt,<br/>

So all the honour they have won,                              865<br/>

Or we have lost, is much as one,<br/>

'Twas well we made so resolute<br/>

And brave retreat without pursuit;<br/>

For if we had not, we had sped<br/>

Much worse, to be in triumph led;                             870<br/>

Than which the ancients held no state<br/>

Of man's life more unfortunate.<br/>

But if this bold adventure e'er<br/>

Do chance to reach the widow's ear,<br/>

It may, b'ing destin'd to assert                              875<br/>

Her sex's honour, reach her heart:<br/>

And as such homely treats (they say)<br/>

Portend good fortune, so this may.<br/>

&lt;u&gt; VESPASIAN being daub'd with dirt,<br/>

Was destin'd to the empire for't;                             880<br/>

And from a Scavenger did come<br/>

To be a mighty Prince in Rome<br/>

And why may not this foul address<br/>

Presage in love the same success<br/>

Then let us straight, to cleanse our wounds,                  885<br/>

Advance in quest of nearest ponds,<br/>

And after (as we first design'd)<br/>

Swear I've perform'd what she enjoin'd.<br/>
