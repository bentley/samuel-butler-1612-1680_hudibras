<p>Doubtless the pleasure is as great<br/>

Of being cheated as to cheat;<br/>

As lookers-on feel most delight,<br/>

That least perceive a jugler's slight;<br/>

And still the less they understand,                             5<br/>

The more th' admire his slight of hand.<br/>
</p>

<p>Some with a noise, and greasy light,<br/>

Are snapt, as men catch larks by night;<br/>

Ensnar'd and hamper'd by the soul,<br/>

As nooses by their legs catch fowl                             l0<br/>

Some with a med'cine, and receipt,<br/>

Are  drawn to nibble at the bait;<br/>

And tho' it be a two-foot trout,<br/>

'Tis with a single hair pull'd out.<br/>
</p>

<p>Others believe no voice t' an organ                            15<br/>

So sweet as lawyer's in his bar-gown,<br/>

Until with subtle cobweb-cheats<br/>

Th'are catch'd in knotted law, like nets;<br/>

In which, when once they are imbrangled,<br/>

The more they stir, the more they're tangled;                  20<br/>

And while their purses can dispute,<br/>

There's no end of th' immortal suit.<br/>
</p>

<p>Others still gape t' anticipate<br/>

The cabinet-designs of fate;<br/>

Apply to wizards, to foresee                                   25<br/>

What shall and what shall never be;<br/>

And, as those vultures do forebode,<br/>

Believe events prove bad or good:<br/>

A flam more senseless than the roguery<br/>

Of old aruspicy and aug'ry.                                    30<br/>

That out of garbages of cattle<br/>

Presag'd th' events of truce or battle;<br/>

From flight of birds, or chickens pecking,<br/>

Success of great'st attempts would reckon:<br/>

Though cheats, yet more intelligible                           35<br/>

Than those that with the stars do fribble.<br/>

This HUDIBRAS by proof found true,<br/>

As in due time and place we'll shew:<br/>

For he, with beard and face made clean,<br/>

B'ing mounted on his steed agen,                               40<br/>

(And RALPHO got a cock-horse too<br/>

Upon his beast, with much ado)<br/>

Advanc'd on for the Widow's house,<br/>

To acquit himself, and pay his vows;<br/>

When various thoughts began to bustle,                         45<br/>

And with his inward man to justle<br/>

He thought what danger might accrue<br/>

If she should find he swore untrue;<br/>

Or if his squire or he should fail,<br/>

And not be punctual in their tale:                             50<br/>

It might at once the ruin prove<br/>

Both of his honour, faith, and love.<br/>

But if he should forbear to go,<br/>

She might conclude h'had broke his vow;<br/>

And that he durst not now for-shame                            55<br/>

Appear in court to try his claim.<br/>

This was the pen'worth of his thought,<br/>

To pass time and uneasy trot.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, In all my past adventures<br/>

I ne'er was set so on the tenters;                             60<br/>

Or taken tardy with dilemma,<br/>

That ev'ry way I turn does hem me,<br/>

And with inextricable doubt<br/>

Besets my puzzled wits about:<br/>

For tho' the dame has been my bail,                            65<br/>

To free me from enchanted jail,<br/>

Yet as a dog, committed close<br/>

For some offence, by chance breaks loose,<br/>

And quits his clog, but all in vain,<br/>

He still draws after him his chain;                            70<br/>

So, though my ankle she has quitted,<br/>

My heart continues still committed;<br/>

And like a bail'd and main-priz'd lover,<br/>

Altho' at large, I am bound over;<br/>

And when I shall appear in court,                              75<br/>

To plead my cause, and answer for't,<br/>

Unless the judge do partial prove,<br/>

What will become of me and love?<br/>

For if in our account we vary,<br/>

Or but in circumstance miscarry;                               80<br/>

Or if she put me to strict proof,<br/>

And make me pull my doublet off,<br/>

To shew, by evident record<br/>

Writ on my skin, I've kept my Word;<br/>

How can I e'er expect to have her,                             85<br/>

Having demurr'd onto her favour?<br/>

But faith, and love, and honour lost,.<br/>

Shall be reduc'd t' a Knight o' th' Post.<br/>

Beside, that stripping may prevent<br/>

What I'm to prove by argument,                                 90<br/>

And justify I have a tail<br/>

And that way, too, my proof may fail.<br/>

Oh that I cou'd enucleate,<br/>

And solve the problems of my fate<br/>

Or find, by necromantick art,                                  95<br/>

How far the dest'nies take my part<br/>

For if I were not more than certain<br/>

To win and wear her, and her fortune,<br/>

I'd go no farther in his courtship,<br/>

To hazard soul, estate, and worship                           100<br/>

For though an oath obliges not<br/>

Where any thing is to be got,<br/>

(As thou last prov'd) yet 'tis profane,<br/>

And sinful, when men swear in vain.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth RALPH, Not far from hence doth dwell                    105<br/>

A cunning man, hight SIDROPHEL,<br/>

That deals in destiny's dark counsels,<br/>

And sage opinions of the Moon sells;<br/>

To whom all people, far and near,<br/>

On deep importances repair;                                   110<br/>

When brass and pewter hap to stray,<br/>

And linen slinks out of the way;<br/>

When geese and pullen are seduc'd,<br/>

And sows of sucking-pigs are chows'd;<br/>

When cattle feel indisposition,                               115<br/>

And need th' opinion of physician;<br/>

When murrain reigns in hogs or sheep.<br/>

And chickens languish of the pip;<br/>

When yeast and outward means do fail,<br/>

And have no pow'r to work on ale:                             120<br/>

When butter does refuse to come,<br/>

And love proves cross and humoursome:<br/>

To him with questions, and with urine,<br/>

They for discov'ry flock, or curing.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, This SIDROPHEL                                125<br/>

I've heard of, and should like it well,<br/>

If thou canst prove the Saints have freedom<br/>

To go to Sorc'rers when they need 'em.<br/>
</p>

<p>Says RALPHO, There's no doubt of that<br/>

Whose principles I quoted late,                               130<br/>

Prove that the Godly may alledge<br/>

For any thing their Privilege;<br/>

And to the Dev'l himself may go,<br/>

If they have motives thereunto.<br/>

For, as there is a war between                                135<br/>

The Dev'l and them, it is no sin,<br/>

If they by subtle stratagem<br/>

Make use of him, as he does them.<br/>

Has not this present Parliament<br/>

A Ledger to the Devil sent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-105" id="noteref-105" epub:type="noteref">105</a>                               140<br/>

Fully impowr'd to treat about<br/>

Finding revolted witches out<br/>

And has not he, within a year,<br/>

Hang'd threescore of 'em in one shire?<br/>

Some only for not being drown'd,                              145<br/>

And some for sitting above ground,<br/>

Whole days and nights, upon their breeches,<br/>

And feeling pain, were hang'd for witches.<br/>

And some for putting knavish tricks<br/>

Upon green geese and turky-chicks,                            150<br/>

And pigs, that suddenly deceast<br/>

Of griefs unnat'ral, as he guest;<br/>

Who after prov'd himself a witch<br/>

And made a rod for his own breech.<br/>

Did not the Devil appear to MARTIN                            155<br/>

LUTHER in Germany for certain;<br/>

And wou'd have gull'd him with a trick,<br/>

But Martin was too politick?<br/>

Did he not help the Dutch to purge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-106" id="noteref-106" epub:type="noteref">106</a><br/>

At ANTWERP their Cathedral Church?                            160<br/>

Sing catches to the Saints at MASCON,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-107" id="noteref-107" epub:type="noteref">107</a><br/>

And tell them all they came to ask him<br/>

Appear'd in divers shapes to KELLY,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-108" id="noteref-108" epub:type="noteref">108</a><br/>

And speak i' th' Nun of LOUDON's belly?<br/>

Meet with the Parliament's Committee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-109" id="noteref-109" epub:type="noteref">109</a>                      165<br/>

At WOODSTOCK on a pers'nal treaty?<br/>

At SARUM take a cavalier<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-110" id="noteref-110" epub:type="noteref">110</a><br/>

I' th' Cause's service prisoner<br/>

As WITHERS, in immortal rhime,<br/>

Has register'd to after-time!                                 170<br/>

Do not nor great Reformers use<br/>

This SIDROPHEL to forebode news?<br/>

To write of victories next year,<br/>

And castles taken yet i' th' air<br/>

Of battles fought at sea, and ships                           175<br/>

Sank two years hence, the last eclipse?<br/>

A total overthrow giv'n the King<br/>

In Cornwall, horse and foot, next Spring!<br/>

And has not he point-blank foretold<br/>

Whats'e'er the Close Committee would?                         180<br/>

Made Mars and Saturn for the Cause<br/>

The moon for Fundamental Laws?<br/>

The Ram, the Bull, and Goat declare<br/>

Against the Book of Common-Pray'r?<br/>

The Scorpion take the Protestation,                           185<br/>

And Bear engage for Reformation?<br/>

Made all the Royal Stars recant,<br/>

Compound and take the Covenant?<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, The case is clear,<br/>

The Saints may 'mploy a Conjurer,                             190<br/>

As thou hast prov'd it by their practice;<br/>

No argument like matter of fact is;<br/>

And we are best of all led to<br/>

Men's principles by what they do.<br/>

Then let us straight advance in quest                         195<br/>

Of this profound Gymnosophist<br/>

And as the Fates and he advise,<br/>

Pursue or wave this enterprise,<br/>
</p>

<p>This said, he turn'd about his steed,<br/>

And eftsoons on th' adventure rid;                            200<br/>

Where leave we him and RALPH a while,<br/>

And to the Conjurer turn our stile,<br/>

To let our reader understand<br/>

What's useful of him before-hand.<br/>
</p>

<p>He had been long t'wards mathematicks,                        205<br/>

Optics, philosophy, and staticks,<br/>

Magick, horoscopy, astrology,<br/>

And was old dog at physiology<br/>

But as a dog that turns the spit<br/>

Bestirs himself, and plies his feet,                          210<br/>

To climb the wheel, but all in vain,<br/>

His own weight brings him down again,<br/>

And still he's in the self-same place<br/>

Where at his setting out h was<br/>

So in the circle of the arts                                  215<br/>

Did he advance his nat'ral parts,<br/>

Till falling back still, for retreat,<br/>

He fell to juggle, cant, and cheat:<br/>

For as those fowls that live in water<br/>

Are never wet, he did but smatter:                            220<br/>

Whate'er he labour'd to appear,<br/>

His understanding still was clear<br/>

Yet none a deeper knowledge boasted,<br/>

Since old HODGE-BACON and BOB GROSTED.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-111" id="noteref-111" epub:type="noteref">111</a><br/>

Th' Intelligible World he knew,                               225<br/>

And all men dream on't to be true;<br/>

That in this world there's not a wart<br/>

That has not there a counterpart;<br/>

Nor can there on the face of ground<br/>

An individual beard be found,                                 230<br/>

That has not, in that foreign nation,<br/>

A fellow of the self-same fashion<br/>

So cut, so colour'd, and so curl'd,<br/>

As those are in th' Inferior World.<br/>

H' had read DEE's Prefaces before,                            235<br/>

The DEV'L, and EUCLID, o'er and o'er;<br/>

And all the intrigues 'twixt him and KELLY,<br/>

LESCUS and th' EMPEROR, wou'd tell ye;<br/>

But with the Moon was more familiar<br/>

Than e'er was almanack well-willer;                           240<br/>

Her secrets understood so clear,<br/>

That some believ'd he had been there;<br/>

Knew when she was in the fittest mood<br/>

For cutting corns, or letting blood;<br/>

When for anointing scabs or itches,                           245<br/>

Or to the bum applying leeches;<br/>

When sows and bitches may be spay'd,<br/>

And in what sign best cyder's made:<br/>

Whether the wane be, or increase,<br/>

Best to set garlick, or sow pease:                            250<br/>

Who first found out the Man i' th' Moon,<br/>

That to the ancients was unknown;<br/>

How many dukes, and earls, and peers,<br/>

Are in the planetary spheres;<br/>

Their airy empire and command,                                255<br/>

Their sev'ral strengths by sea and land;<br/>

What factions th' have, and what they drive at<br/>

In public vogue, or what in private;<br/>

With what designs and interests<br/>

Each party manages contests.                                  260<br/>

He made an instrument to know<br/>

If the Moon shine at full or no;<br/>

That wou'd as soon as e'er she shone, straight<br/>

Whether 'twere day or night demonstrate;<br/>

Tell what her d'meter t' an inch is,                          265<br/>

And prove that she's not made of green cheese.<br/>

It wou'd demonstrate, that the Man in<br/>

The Moon's a Sea Mediterranean;<br/>

And that it is no dog nor bitch,<br/>

That stands behind him at his breech,                         270<br/>

But a huge Caspian Sea, or lake,<br/>

With arms, which men for legs mistake;<br/>

How large a gulph his tail composes,<br/>

And what a goodly bay his nose is;<br/>

How many German leagues by th' scale                          275<br/>

Cape Snout's from Promontory Tail.<br/>

He made a planetary gin,<br/>

Which rats would run their own heads in,<br/>

And cause on purpose to be taken,<br/>

Without th' expence of cheese or bacon.                       280<br/>

With lute-strings he would counterfeit<br/>

Maggots that crawl on dish of meat:<br/>

Quote moles and spots on any place<br/>

O' th' body, by the index face:<br/>

Detect lost maiden-heads by sneezing,                         285<br/>

Or breaking wind of dames, or pissing;<br/>

Cure warts and corns with application<br/>

Of med'cines to th' imagination;<br/>

Fright agues into dogs, and scare<br/>

With rhimes the tooth-ach and catarrh;                        290<br/>

Chace evil spirits away by dint<br/>

Of cickle, horse-shoe, hollow-flint;<br/>

Spit fire out of a walnut-shell,<br/>

Which made the Roman slaves rebel;<br/>

And fire a mine in China here                                 295<br/>

With sympathetic gunpowder.<br/>

He knew whats'ever's to be known,<br/>

But much more than he knew would own;<br/>

What med'cine 'twas that PARACELSUS<br/>

Could make a man with, as he tells us;                        300<br/>

What figur'd slates are best to make<br/>

On watry surface duck or drake;<br/>

What bowling-stones, in running race<br/>

Upon a board, have swiftest pace;<br/>

Whether a pulse beat in the black                             305<br/>

List of a dappled louse's back;<br/>

If systole or diastole move<br/>

Quickest when he's in wrath or love<br/>

When two of them do run a race,<br/>

Whether they gallop, trot, or pace:                           310<br/>

How many scores a flea will jump,<br/>

Of his own length, from head to rump;<br/>

Which SOCRATES and CHAEREPHON,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-112" id="noteref-112" epub:type="noteref">112</a><br/>

In vain, assay'd so long agon;<br/>

Whether his snout a perfect nose is,                          315<br/>

And not an elephant's proboscis<br/>

How many diff'rent specieses<br/>

Of maggots breed in rotten cheese<br/>

And which are next of kin to those<br/>

Engender'd in a chandler's nose;                              320<br/>

Or those not seen, but understood,<br/>

That live in vinegar and wood.<br/>
</p>

<p>A paultry wretch he had, half-starv'd,<br/>

That him in place of Zany serv'd.<br/>

Hight WHACHUM, bred to dash and draw,                         325<br/>

Not wine, but more unwholesome law<br/>

To make 'twixt words and lines huge gaps,<br/>

Wide as meridians in maps;<br/>

To squander paper, and spare ink,<br/>

And cheat men of their words, some think.                     330<br/>

From this, by merited degrees,<br/>

He'd to more high advancement rise;<br/>

To be an under-conjurer,<br/>

A journeyman astrologer.<br/>

His business was to pump and wheedle,                         335<br/>

And men with their own keys unriddle;<br/>

And make them to themselves give answers,<br/>

For which they pay the necromancers;<br/>

To fetch and carry intelligence,<br/>

Of whom, and what, and where, and whence,                     340<br/>

And all discoveries disperse<br/>

Among th' whole pack of conjurers<br/>

What cut-purses have left with them<br/>

For the right owners to redeem;<br/>

And what they dare not vent find out,                         345<br/>

To gain themselves and th' art repute;<br/>

Draw figures, schemes, and horoscopes,<br/>

Of Newgate, Bridewell, brokers' shops,<br/>

Of thieves ascendant in the cart;<br/>

And find out all by rules of art;                             350<br/>

Which way a serving-man, that's run<br/>

With cloaths or money away, is gone:<br/>

Who pick'd a fob at holding forth;<br/>

And where a watch, for half the worth,<br/>

May be redeem'd; or stolen plate                              355<br/>

Restor'd at conscionable rate.<br/>

Beside all this, he serv'd his master<br/>

In quality of poetaster;<br/>

And rhimes appropriate could make<br/>

To ev'ry month i' th almanack                                 360<br/>

What terms begin and end could tell,<br/>

With their returns, in doggerel;<br/>

When the exchequer opes and shuts,<br/>

And sowgelder with safety cuts<br/>

When men may eat and drink their fill,                        365<br/>

And when be temp'rate, if they will;<br/>

When use and when abstain from vice,<br/>

Figs, grapes, phlebotomy, and spice.<br/>

And as in prison mean rogues beat<br/>

Hemp for the service of the great,                            370<br/>

So WHACHUM beats his dirty brains,<br/>

T' advance his master's fame and gains<br/>

And, like the Devil's oracles,<br/>

Put into doggrel rhimes his spells,<br/>

Which, over ev'ry month's blank page                          375<br/>

I' th' almanack, strange bilks presage.<br/>

He would an elegy compose<br/>

On maggots squeez'd out of his nose;<br/>

In lyrick numbers write an ode on<br/>

His mistress, eating a black-pudden:                          380<br/>

And when imprison'd air escap'd her,<br/>

It puft him with poetic rapture.<br/>

His sonnets charm'd th' attentive crowd,<br/>

By wide-mouth'd mortal troll'd aloud,<br/>

That 'circl'd with his long-ear'd guests,                     385<br/>

Like ORPHEUS look'd among the beasts.<br/>

A carman's horse could not pass by,<br/>

But stood ty'd up to poetry:<br/>

No porter's burthen pass'd along,<br/>

But serv'd for burthen to his song:                           390<br/>

Each window like a pill'ry appears,<br/>

With heads thrust through, nail'd by the ears<br/>

All trades run in as to the sight<br/>

Of monsters, or their dear delight<br/>

The gallow tree, when cutting purse                           395<br/>

Breeds bus'ness for heroic verse,<br/>

Which none does hear, but would have hung<br/>

T' have been the theme of such a song.<br/>
</p>

<p>Those two together long had liv'd,<br/>

In mansion prudently contriv'd;                               400<br/>

Where neither tree nor house could bar<br/>

The free detection of a star<br/>

And nigh an ancient obelisk<br/>

Was rais'd by him, found out by FISK,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-113" id="noteref-113" epub:type="noteref">113</a><br/>

On which was a written not in words,                          405<br/>

But hieroglyphic mute of birds,<br/>

Many rare pithy saws concerning<br/>

The worth of astrologic learning.<br/>

From top of this there hung a rope,<br/>

To a which he fasten'd telescope;                             410<br/>

The spectacles with which the stars<br/>

He reads in smallest characters.<br/>

It happen'd as a boy, one night,<br/>

Did fly his tarsel of a kite,<br/>

The strangest long-wing'd hawk that flies,                    415<br/>

That, like a bird of Paradise,<br/>

Or herald's martlet, has no legs,<br/>

Nor hatches young ones, nor lays eggs;<br/>

His train was six yards long, milk-white,<br/>

At th' end of which there hung a light,                       420<br/>

Inclos'd in lanthorn, made of paper,<br/>

That far off like a star did appear.<br/>

This SIDROPHEL by chance espy'd,<br/>

And with amazement staring wide,<br/>

Bless us! quoth he, what dreadful wonder                      425<br/>

Is that appears in heaven yonder?<br/>

A comet, and without a beard!<br/>

Or star that ne'er before appear'd!<br/>

I'm certain 'tis not in the scrowl<br/>

Of all those beasts, and fish, and fowl,                      430<br/>

With which, like Indian plantations,<br/>

The learned stock the constellations<br/>

Nor those that draw for signs have bin<br/>

To th' houses where the planets inn.<br/>

It must be supernatural,                                      435<br/>

Unless it be that cannon-ball<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-114" id="noteref-114" epub:type="noteref">114</a><br/>

That, shot i' th' air point-blank upright,<br/>

Was borne to that prodigious height,<br/>

That learn'd Philosophers maintain,<br/>

It ne'er came backwards down again;                           440<br/>

But in the airy region yet<br/>

Hangs like the body of MAHOMET<br/>

For if it be above the shade<br/>

That by the earth's round bulk is made,<br/>

'Tis probable it may from far                                 445<br/>

Appear no bullet, but a star.<br/>
</p>

<p>This said, he to his engine flew,<br/>

Plac'd near at hand, in open view,<br/>

And rais'd it 'till it levell'd right<br/>

Against the glow-worm tail of kite,                           450<br/>

Then peeping thro', Bless us! (quoth he)<br/>

It is a planet, now I see<br/>

And, if I err not, by his proper<br/>

Figure, that's like tobacco-stopper,<br/>

It should be Saturn. Yes, 'tis clear                          455<br/>

'Tis Saturn; but what makes him there?<br/>

He's got between the Dragon's Tail<br/>

And farther Leg behind o' th' Whale.<br/>

Pray heav'n divert the fatal omen,<br/>

For 'tis a prodigy not common;                                460<br/>

And can no less than the world's end,<br/>

Or Nature's funeral, portend.<br/>
</p>

<p>With that he fell again to pry.<br/>

Thro' perspective more wistfully,<br/>

When by mischance the fatal string,                           465<br/>

That kept the tow'ring fowl on wing,<br/>

Breaking, down fell the star. Well shot,<br/>

Quoth WHACHUM, who right wisely thought<br/>

H' had levell'd at a star, and hit it<br/>

But SIDROPHEL, more subtle-witted,                            470<br/>

Cry'd out, What horrible and fearful<br/>

Portent is this, to see a star fall?<br/>

It threatens nature, and the doom<br/>

Will not be long before it come<br/>

When stars do fail, 'tis plain enough,                        475<br/>

The day of judgment's not far off;<br/>

As lately 'twas reveal'd to SEDGWICK,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-115" id="noteref-115" epub:type="noteref">115</a><br/>

And some of us find out by magick.<br/>

Then since the time we have to live<br/>

In this world's shorten'd, let us strive                      480<br/>

To make our best advantage of it,<br/>

And pay our losses with our profit.<br/>
</p>

<p>This feat fell out not long before<br/>

The Knight, upon the forenam'd score,<br/>

In quest of SIDROPHEL advancing,                              485<br/>

Was now in prospect of the mansion<br/>

Whom he discov'ring, turn'd his glass,<br/>

And found far off, 'twas HUDIBRAS.<br/>
</p>

<p>WHACHUM, (quoth he), look yonder, some<br/>

To try or use our art are come                                490<br/>

The one's the learned Knight: seek out,<br/>

And pump 'em what they come about.<br/>

WHACHUM advanc'd, with all submissness,<br/>

T' accost em, but much more their bus'ness.<br/>

He held a stirrup, while the Knight                           495<br/>

From leathern bare-bones did alight<br/>

And taking from his hand the bridle,<br/>

Approach'd the dark Squire to unriddle.<br/>

He gave him first the time o' th' day,<br/>

And welcom'd him, as he might say:                            500<br/>

He ask'd him whence he came, and whither<br/>

Their bus'ness lay? Quoth RALPHO, Hither.<br/>

Did you not lose? Quoth RALPHO, Nay.<br/>

Quoth WHACHUM, Sir, I meant your way!<br/>

Your Knight — Quoth RALPHO, Is a lover,                      505<br/>

And pains intolerable doth suffer:<br/>

For lovers' hearts are not their own hearts,<br/>

Nor lights, nor lungs, and so forth downwards.<br/>

What time, (quoth RALPHO), Sir? — Too long<br/>

Three years it off and on has hung. —                        510<br/>

Quoth he, I meant what time o'the day 'tis. —<br/>

Quoth RALPHO, Between seven and eight 'tis.<br/>

Why then, (quoth Whachum) my small art<br/>

Tells me, the dame has a hard heart,<br/>

Or great estate. — Quoth RALPH, A jointer,                   515<br/>

Which makes him have so hot a mind t'her.<br/>

Mean while the Knight was making water,<br/>

Before he fell upon the matter;<br/>

Which having done, the Wizard steps in,<br/>

To give him suitable reception                                520<br/>

But kept his bus'ness at a bay<br/>

Till WHACHUM put him in the way;<br/>

Who having now, by RALPHO's light.<br/>

Expounded th' errand of the Knight,<br/>

And what he came to know, drew near,                          525<br/>

To whisper in the Conj'rer's ear,<br/>

Which he prevented thus: What was't,<br/>

Quoth he, that I was saying last,<br/>

Before these gentlemen arriv'd?<br/>

Quoth WHACHUM, Venus you retriev'd,                           530<br/>

In opposition with Mars,<br/>

And no benigne friendly stars<br/>

T' allay the effect. — Quoth Wizard, So<br/>

In Virgo? Ha! — Quoth WHACHUM, No.<br/>

Has Saturn nothing to do in it?                               535<br/>

One-tenth of's circle to a minute.<br/>

'Tis well, quoth he. — Sir, you'll excuse<br/>

This rudeness I am forc'd to use<br/>

It is a scheme and face of Heaven,<br/>

As the aspects are dispos'd this even,                        540<br/>

I was contemplating upon<br/>

When you arriv'd; but now I've done,<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, If I appear<br/>

Unseasonable in coming here<br/>

At such a tone, to interrupt,                                 545<br/>

Your speculations, which I hop'd<br/>

Assistance from, and come to use,<br/>

'T is fit that I ask your excuse.<br/>

By no means, Sir, quoth SIDROPHEL;<br/>

The stars your coming did foretel:                            550<br/>

I did expect you here, and knew,<br/>

Before you spake, your bus'ness too.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, Make that appear,<br/>

And I shall credit whatsoe'er<br/>

You tell me after on your word,                               555<br/>

Howe'er unlikely, or absurd.<br/>
</p>

<p>You are in love, Sir, with a widow,<br/>

Quoth he, that does not greatly heed you,<br/>

And for three years has rid your wit<br/>

And passion without drawing bit:                              560<br/>

And now your bus'ness is to know,<br/>

If you shall carry her or no.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, You're in the right;<br/>

But how the Devil you came by't<br/>

I can't imagine; for the Stars,                               565<br/>

I'm sure, can tell no more than a horse;<br/>

Nor can their aspects (though you pore<br/>

Your eyes out on 'em) tell you more<br/>

Than th' oracle of sieve and sheers,<br/>

That turns as certain as the spheres:                         570<br/>

But if the Devil's of your counsel,<br/>

Much may be done my noble Donzel;<br/>

And 'tis on his account I come,<br/>

To know from you my fatal doom.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth SIDROPHEL, If you Suppose,                              575<br/>

Sir Knight, that I am one of those,<br/>

I might suspect, and take the alarm,<br/>

Your bus'ness is but to inform;<br/>

But if it be, 'tis ne'er the near;<br/>

You have a wrong sow by the ear;                              580<br/>

For I assure you, for my part,<br/>

I only deal by rules of art,<br/>

Such as are lawful, and judge by<br/>

Conclusions of Astrology:<br/>

But for the Dev'l, know nothing by him;                       585<br/>

But only this, that I defy him.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, Whatever others deem ye,<br/>

I understand your metonymy:<br/>

Your words of second-hand intention,<br/>

When things by wrongful names you mention;                    590<br/>

The mystick sense of all your terms,<br/>

That are, indeed, but magick charms<br/>

To raise the Devil, and mean one thing,<br/>

And that is down-right conjuring;<br/>

And in itself more warrantable,                               595<br/>

Than cheat, or canting to a rabble,<br/>

Or putting tricks upon the Moon,<br/>

Which by confed'racy are done.<br/>

Your ancient conjurers were wont<br/>

To make her from her sphere dismount.                         600<br/>

And to their incantations stoop:<br/>

They scorn'd to pore thro' telescope,<br/>

Or idly play at bo-peep with her,<br/>

To find out cloudy or fair weather,<br/>

Which ev'ry almanack can tell,                                605<br/>

Perhaps, as learnedly and well,<br/>

As you yourself — Then, friend, I doubt<br/>

You go the furthest way about.<br/>

Your modern Indian magician<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-116" id="noteref-116" epub:type="noteref">116</a><br/>

Makes but a hole in th' earth to piss in,                     610<br/>

And straight resolves all questions by't,<br/>

And seldom fails to be i'th' right.<br/>

The Rosy-Crucian way's more sure<br/>

To bring the Devil to the lure;<br/>

Each of 'em has a sev'ral gin                                 615<br/>

To catch intelligences in.<br/>

Some by the nose with fumes trepan 'em,<br/>

As DUNSTAN did the Devil's grannam;<br/>

Others, with characters and words,<br/>

Catch 'em, as men in nets do birds;                           620<br/>

And some with symbols, signs, and tricks,<br/>

Engrav'd with planetary nicks,<br/>

With their own influences will fetch 'em<br/>

Down from their orbs, arrest, and catch 'em;<br/>

Make 'em depose and answer to                                 625<br/>

All questions e're they let them go.<br/>

BUMBASTUS kept a Devil's bird<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-117" id="noteref-117" epub:type="noteref">117</a><br/>

Shut in the pummel of his sword,<br/>

That taught him all the cunning pranks<br/>

Of past and future mountebanks.                               630<br/>

KELLY did all his feats upon<br/>

The Devil's looking-glass, a stone;<br/>

Where playing with him at bo-peep,<br/>

He solv'd all problems ne'er so deep.<br/>

AGRIPPA kept a Stygian pug,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-118" id="noteref-118" epub:type="noteref">118</a>                               635<br/>

I' th' garb and habit of a dog,<br/>

That was his tutor, and the cur<br/>

Read to th' occult philosopher,<br/>

And taught him subt'ly to maintain<br/>

All other sciences are vain.                                  640<br/>
</p>

<p>To this, quoth SIDROPHELLO, Sir,<br/>

AGRIPPA was no conjurer,<br/>

Nor PARACELSUS, no, nor BEHMEN;<br/>

Nor was the dog a Cacodaemon,<br/>

But a true dog, that would shew tricks                        645<br/>

For th' emperor, and leap o'er sticks;<br/>

Would fetch and carry; was more civil<br/>

Than other dogs, but yet no Devil;<br/>

And whatsoe'er he's said to do,<br/>

He went the self-same way we go.                              650<br/>

As for the Rosy-Cross Philosophers,<br/>

Whom you will have to be but sorcerers,<br/>

What they pretend to is no more,<br/>

Than TRISMEGISTUS did before,<br/>

PYTHAGORAS, old ZOROASTER,                                    655<br/>

And APOLLONIUS their master;<br/>

To whom they do confess they owe<br/>

All that they do, and all they know.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, Alas! what is't t' us,<br/>

Whether 'twas said by TRISMEGISTUS,                           660<br/>

If it be nonsense, false, or mystick,<br/>

Or not intelligible, or sophistick?<br/>

'Tis not antiquity, nor author,<br/>

That makes Truth Truth, altho' Times daughter;<br/>

'Twas he that put her in the pit                              665<br/>

Before he pull'd her out of it;<br/>

And as he eats his sons, just so<br/>

He feeds upon his daughters too.<br/>

Nor does it follow, 'cause a herald,<br/>

Can make a gentleman, scarce a year old,                      670<br/>

To be descended of a race<br/>

Of ancient kings in a small space,<br/>

That we should all opinions hold<br/>

Authentic that we can make old.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth SIDROPHEL, It is no part                                675<br/>

Of prudence to cry down an art,<br/>

And what it may perform deny,<br/>

Because you understand not why<br/>

(As AVERHOIS play'd but a mean trick<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-119" id="noteref-119" epub:type="noteref">119</a><br/>

To damn our whole art for eccentrick:)                        680<br/>

For Who knows all that knowledge contains<br/>

Men dwell not on the tops of mountains,<br/>

But on their sides, or rising's seat<br/>

So 'tis with knowledge's vast height.<br/>

Do not the hist'ries of all ages                              685<br/>

Relate miraculous presages,<br/>

Of strange turns in the world's affairs,<br/>

Foreseen b' Astrologers, Soothsayers,<br/>

Chaldeans, learn'd Genethliacks,<br/>

And some that have writ almanacks?                            690<br/>

The MEDIAN emp'ror dreamt his daughter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-120" id="noteref-120" epub:type="noteref">120</a><br/>

Had pist all ASIA under water,<br/>

And that a vine, sprung from her haunches,<br/>

O'erspread his empire with its branches:<br/>

And did not soothsayers expound it,                           695<br/>

As after by th' event he found it?<br/>

When CAESAR in the senate fell,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-121" id="noteref-121" epub:type="noteref">121</a><br/>

Did not the sun eclips'd foretel,<br/>

And, in resentment of his slaughter,<br/>

Look'd pale for almost a year after?                          700<br/>

AUGUSTUS having, b' oversight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-122" id="noteref-122" epub:type="noteref">122</a><br/>

Put on his left shoe 'fore his right,<br/>

Had like to have been slain that day<br/>

By soldiers mutin'ing for pay.<br/>

Are there not myriads of this sort,                           705<br/>

Which stories of all times report?<br/>

Is it not ominous in all countries<br/>

When crows and ravens croak upon trees?<br/>

The Roman senate, when within<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-123" id="noteref-123" epub:type="noteref">123</a><br/>

The city walls an owl was seen                                710<br/>

Did cause their clergy, with lustrations,<br/>

(Our Synod calls humiliations),<br/>

The round-fac'd prodigy t'avert<br/>

From doing town or country hurt<br/>

And if an owl have so much pow'r,                             715<br/>

Why should not planets have much more,<br/>

That in a region far above<br/>

Inferior fowls of the air move,<br/>

And should see further, and foreknow<br/>

More than their augury below?                                 720<br/>

Though that once serv'd the polity<br/>

Of mighty states to govern by<br/>

And this is what we take in hand<br/>

By pow'rful art to understand<br/>

Which, how we have perform'd, all ages                        725<br/>

Can speak th' events of our presages<br/>

Have we not lately, in the Moon,<br/>

Found a New World, to the Old unknown?<br/>

Discover'd sea and land, COLUMBUS<br/>

And MAGELLAN cou'd never compass?                             730<br/>

Made mountains with our tubes appear,<br/>

And cattle grazing on 'em there?<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, You lie so ope,<br/>

That I, without a telescope,<br/>

Can mind your tricks out, and descry                          735<br/>

Where you tell truth, and where you lye:<br/>

For ANAXAGORAS, long agon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-124" id="noteref-124" epub:type="noteref">124</a><br/>

Saw hills, as well as you, i' th' Moon;<br/>

And held the Sun was but a piece<br/>

Of red-hot ir'n, as big as Greece;                            740<br/>

Believ'd the Heav'ns were made of stone,<br/>

Because the Sun had voided one;<br/>

And, rather than he would recant<br/>

Th' opinion, suffer'd banishment.<br/>
</p>

<p>But what, alas! is it to us,                                  745<br/>

Whether i' th' Moon men thus or thus<br/>

Do eat their Porridge, cut their corns,<br/>

Or whether they have tails or horns?<br/>

What trade from thence can you advance,<br/>

But what we nearer have from France?                          750<br/>

What can our travellers bring home,<br/>

That is not to be learnt at Rome?<br/>

What politicks, or strange opinions,<br/>

That are not in our own dominions?<br/>

What science can he brought from thence,                      755<br/>

In which we do not here commence?<br/>

What revelations, or religions,<br/>

That are not in our native regions?<br/>

Are sweating lanthorns, or screen-fans,<br/>

Made better there than th' are in France?                     760<br/>

Or do they teach to sing and play<br/>

O' th' gittar there a newer way?<br/>

Can they make plays there, that shall fit<br/>

The public humour, with less wit?<br/>

Write wittier dances, quainter shows,                         765<br/>

Or fight with more ingenious blows?<br/>

Or does the man i' th' moon look big,<br/>

And wear a huger perriwig,<br/>

Shew in his gait or face more tricks,<br/>

Than our own native lunaticks?                                770<br/>

And if w' out-do him here at home,<br/>

What good of your design can come?<br/>

As wind i' th' hypocondries pent,<br/>

Is but a blast if downward sent,<br/>

But if it upward chance to fly,                               775<br/>

Becomes new Light and Prophecy<br/>

So when your speculations tend<br/>

Above their just and useful end,<br/>

Although they promise strange and great<br/>

Discoveries of things far set,                                780<br/>

They are but idle dreams and fancies,<br/>

And savour strongly of the ganzas.<br/>

Tell me but what's the natural cause,<br/>

Why on a sign no painter draws<br/>

The full moon ever, but the half;                             785<br/>

Resolve that with your JACOB's staff;<br/>

Or why wolves raise a hubbub at her,<br/>

And dogs howl when she shines in water;<br/>

And I shall freely give my vote,<br/>

You may know something more remote.                           790<br/>
</p>

<p>At this deep SIDROPHEL look'd wise,<br/>

And staring round with owl-like eyes,<br/>

He put his face into a posture<br/>

Of sapience, and began to bluster:<br/>

For having three times shook his head                         795<br/>

To stir his wit up, thus he said<br/>

Art has no mortal enemies,<br/>

Next ignorance, but owls and geese;<br/>

Those consecrated geese in orders,<br/>

That to the Capitol were warders;                             800<br/>

And being then upon patrol,<br/>

With noise alone beat off the Gaul:<br/>

Or those Athenian Sceptic owls,<br/>

That will not credit their own souls;<br/>

Or any science understand,                                    805<br/>

Beyond the reach of eye or hand;<br/>

But meas'ring all things by their own<br/>

Knowledge, hold nothing's to be known<br/>

Those wholesale criticks, that in coffee-<br/>

Houses cry down all philosophy,                               810<br/>

And will not know upon what ground<br/>

In nature we our doctrine found,<br/>

Altho' with pregnant evidence<br/>

We can demonstrate it to sense,<br/>

As I just now have done to you,                               815<br/>

Foretelling what you came to know.<br/>

Were the stars only made to light<br/>

Robbers and burglarers by night?<br/>

To wait on drunkards, thieves, gold-finders,<br/>

And lovers solacing behind doors,                             820<br/>

Or giving one another pledges<br/>

Of matrimony under hedges?<br/>

Or witches simpling, and on gibbets<br/>

Cutting from malefactors snippets?<br/>

Or from the pillory tips of ears                              825<br/>

Of Rebel-Saints and perjurers?<br/>

Only to stand by, and look on,<br/>

But not know what is said or done?<br/>

Is there a constellation there,<br/>

That was not born and bred up here?                           830<br/>

And therefore cannot be to learn<br/>

In any inferior concern.<br/>

Were they not, during all their lives,<br/>

Most of 'em pirates, whores and thieves;<br/>

And is it like they have not still                            835<br/>

In their old practices some skill<br/>

Is there a planet that by birth<br/>

Does not derive its house from earth?<br/>

And therefore probably must know,<br/>

What is and hath been done below.                             840<br/>

Who made the Balance, or whence came<br/>

The Bull, the Lion, and the Ram?<br/>

Did not we here the Argo rig,<br/>

Make BERENICE's periwig?<br/>

Whose liv'ry does the Coachman wear?                          845<br/>

Or who made Cassiopeia's chair?<br/>

And therefore, as they came from hence,<br/>

With us may hold intelligence.<br/>

PLATO deny'd the world can be<br/>

Govern'd without geometree,                                   850<br/>

(For money b'ing the common scale<br/>

Of things by measure, weight, and tale,<br/>

In all th' affairs of Church and State,<br/>

'Tis both the balance and the weight;)<br/>

Then much less can it be without                              855<br/>

Divine Astrology made out;<br/>

That puts the other down in worth,<br/>

As far as Heav'n's above the earth.<br/>
</p>

<p>These reasons (quoth the Knight) I grant<br/>

Are something more significant                                860<br/>

Than any that the learned use<br/>

Upon this subject to produce;<br/>

And yet th' are far from satisfactory,<br/>

T' establish and keep up your factory.<br/>

Th' Egyptians say, the Sun has twice                          865<br/>

Shifted his setting and his rise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-125" id="noteref-125" epub:type="noteref">125</a><br/>

Twice has he risen in the west,<br/>

As many times set in the east;<br/>

But whether that be true or no,<br/>

The Dev'l any of you know.                                    870<br/>

Some hold the heavens like a top,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-126" id="noteref-126" epub:type="noteref">126</a><br/>

And kept by circulation. up;<br/>

And, were't not for their wheeling round,<br/>

They'd instantly fall to the ground:<br/>

As sage EMPEDOCLES of old,<br/>

And from him modern authors hold.                             875<br/>

PLATO believ'd the Sun and Moon<br/>

Below all other Planets run.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-127" id="noteref-127" epub:type="noteref">127</a><br/>

Some MERCURY, some VENUS, seat<br/>

Above the Sun himself in height.<br/>

The learned SCALIGER complain'd,                          880<br/>

Gainst what COPERNICUS maintain'd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-128" id="noteref-128" epub:type="noteref">128</a><br/>

That, in twelve hundred years and odd,<br/>

The Sun had left its ancient road,<br/>

And nearer to time earth is come<br/>

'Bove fifty thousand miles from home:                         885<br/>

Swore 'twas a most notorious flam;<br/>

And he that had so little shame<br/>

To vent such fopperies abroad,<br/>

Deserv'd to have his rump well claw'd;<br/>

Which Monsieur BODIN hearing, swore                           890<br/>

That he deserv'd the rod much more,<br/>

That durst upon a truth give doom;<br/>

He knew less than the Pope of Rome.<br/>

CARDAN believ'd great states depend<br/>

Upon the tip o' th' Bear's tail's end;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-129" id="noteref-129" epub:type="noteref">129</a>                        895<br/>

That, as she whisk'd it t'wards the Sun,<br/>

Strow'd mighty empires up and down;<br/>

Which others say must needs be false,<br/>

Because your true bears have no tails.<br/>

Some say the Zodiack Constellations                           900<br/>

Have long since chang'd their antique stations<br/>

Above a sign, and prove the same<br/>

In Taurus now once in the Ram;<br/>

Affirm the trigons chop'd and chang'd,<br/>

The wat'ry with the fiery rang'd:                             905<br/>

Then how can their effects still hold<br/>

To be the same they were of old?<br/>

This, though the art were true, would make<br/>

Our modern soothsayers mistake:                               910<br/>

And in one cause they tell more lies,<br/>

In figures and nativities,<br/>

Than th' old Chaldean conjurers<br/>

In so many hundred thousand years<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-130" id="noteref-130" epub:type="noteref">130</a><br/>

Beside their nonsense in translating,                         915<br/>

For want of accidence and Latin,<br/>

Like Idus, and Calendae, Englisht<br/>

The quarter-days by skilful linguist;<br/>

And yet with canting, sleight and, cheat,<br/>

'Twill serve their turn to do the feat;                       920<br/>

Make fools believe in their foreseeing<br/>

Of things before they are in being<br/>

To swallow gudgeons ere th' are catch'd;<br/>

And count their chickens ere th' are hatch'd<br/>

Make them the constellations prompt,                          925<br/>

And give 'em back their own accompt<br/>

But still the best to him that gives<br/>

The best price for't, or best believes.<br/>

Some towns and cities, some, for brevity,<br/>

Have cast the ’versal world's nativity,                       930<br/>

And made the infant-stars confess,<br/>

Like fools or children, what they please.<br/>

Some calculate the hidden fates<br/>

Of monkeys, puppy-dogs, and cats<br/>

Some running-nags and fighting cocks,                         935<br/>

Some love, trade, law-suits, and the pox;<br/>

Some take a measure of the lives<br/>

Of fathers, mothers, husbands, wives;<br/>

Make opposition, trine, and quartile,<br/>

Tell who is barren, and who fertile;                          940<br/>

As if the planet's first aspect<br/>

The tender infant did infect<br/>

In soul and body, and instill<br/>

All future good, and future ill;<br/>

Which, in their dark fatalities lurking,                      945<br/>

At destin'd periods fall a working;<br/>

And break out, like the hidden seeds<br/>

Of long diseases, into deeds,<br/>

In friendships, enmities, and strife,<br/>

And all the emergencies of life.                              950<br/>

No sooner does he peep into<br/>

The world, but he has done his do;<br/>

Catch'd all diseases, took all physick<br/>

That cures or kills a man that is sick;<br/>

Marry'd his punctual dose of wives;                           955<br/>

Is cuckolded, and breaks or thrives.<br/>

There's but the twinkling of a star<br/>

Between a man of peace and war;<br/>

A thief and justice, fool and knave,<br/>

A huffing officer and a slave;                                960<br/>

A crafty lawyer and a pick-pocket,<br/>

A great philosopher and a blockhead;<br/>

A formal preacher and a player,<br/>

A learn'd physician and manslayer.<br/>

As if men from the stars did suck                             965<br/>

Old age, diseases, and ill-luck,<br/>

Wit, folly, honour, virtue, vice,<br/>

Trade, travel, women, claps, and dice;<br/>

And draw, with the first air they breathe,<br/>

Battle and murder, sudden death.                              970<br/>

Are not these fine commodities<br/>

To be imported from the skies,<br/>

And vended here amongst the rabble,<br/>

For staple goods and warrantable?<br/>

Like money by the Druids borrow'd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-131" id="noteref-131" epub:type="noteref">131</a>                        975<br/>

In th' other world to be restor'd?<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth SIDROPHEL, To let you know<br/>

You wrong the art, and artists too,<br/>

Since arguments are lost on those<br/>

That do our principles oppose,                                980<br/>

I will (although I've done't before)<br/>

Demonstrate to your sense once more,<br/>

And draw a figure, that shall tell you<br/>

What you, perhaps, forget befel you,<br/>

By way of horary inspection,                                  985<br/>

Which some account our worst erection.<br/>

With that he circles draws, and squares,<br/>

With cyphers, astral characters;<br/>

Then looks 'em o'er, to und'erstand 'em,<br/>

Although set down hob-nab, at random.                         990<br/>

Quoth he, This scheme of th' heavens set,<br/>

Discovers how in fight you met<br/>

At Kingston with a may-pole idol,<br/>

And that y' were bang'd both back and side well;<br/>

And though you overcame the bear,                             995<br/>

The dogs beat you at Brentford fair;<br/>

Where sturdy butchers broke your noddle,<br/>

And handled you like a fop-doodle.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, I now perceive<br/>

You are no conj'rer, by your leave;                          1000<br/>

That paultry story is untrue,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-132" id="noteref-132" epub:type="noteref">132</a><br/>

And forg'd to cheat such gulls as you.<br/>
</p>

<p>Not true? quoth he; howe'er you vapour,<br/>

I can what I affirm make appear.<br/>

WHACHUM shall justify't t' your face,                        1005<br/>

And prove he was upon the place.<br/>

He play'd the Saltinbancho's part,<br/>

Transform'd t' a Frenchman by my art<br/>

He stole your cloak, and pick'd your pocket,<br/>

Chows'd and caldes'd ye like a blockhead:                    1010<br/>

And what you lost I can produce,<br/>

If you deny it, here i' th' house.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, I do believe<br/>

That argument's demonstrative.<br/>

RALPHO, bear witness; and go fetch us                        1015<br/>

A constable to seize the wretches<br/>

For though th' are both false knaves and cheats,<br/>

Impostors, jugglers, counterfeits,<br/>

I'll make them serve for perpendiculars<br/>

As true as e'er were us'd by bricklayers.                    1020<br/>

They're guilty, by their own confessions,<br/>

Of felony, and at the sessions,<br/>

Upon the bench, I will so handle 'em,<br/>

That the vibration of this pendulum<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-133" id="noteref-133" epub:type="noteref">133</a><br/>

Shalt make all taylors yards of one                          1025<br/>

Unanimous opinion,<br/>

A thing he long has vapour'd of,<br/>

But now shall wake it out of proof.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth SIDROPHEL, I do not doubt<br/>

To find friends that will bear me out,                       1030<br/>

Nor have I hazarded my art,<br/>

And neck, so long on the state's part,<br/>

To be expos'd i' th' end to suffer<br/>

By such a braggadocio huffer.<br/>
</p>

<p>Huffer! quoth HUDIBRAS: this sword                           1035<br/>

Shall down thy false throat craw that word.<br/>

RALPHO, make haste, and call an officer,<br/>

To apprehend this Stygian sophister,<br/>

Meanwhile I'll hold 'em at a bay,<br/>

Lest he and WHACHUM run away.                                1040<br/>
</p>

<p>But SIDROPHEL who, from the aspect<br/>

Of HUDIBRAS did now erect<br/>

A figure worse portenting far<br/>

Than that of a malignant star,<br/>

Believ'd it now the fittest moment                           1045<br/>

To shun the danger that might come on't,<br/>

While HUDIBRAS was all alone,<br/>

And he and WHACHUM, two to one.<br/>

This being resolv'd, he spy'd, by chance,<br/>

Behind the door, an iron lance,                              1050<br/>

That many a sturdy limb had gor'd,<br/>

And legs, and loins, and shoulders bor'd:<br/>

He snatch'd it up, and made a pass,<br/>

To make his way through HUDIBRAS.<br/>

WHACHUM had got a fire-fork,                                 1055<br/>

With which he vow'd to do his work.<br/>

But HUDIBRAS was well prepar'd,<br/>

And stoutly stood upon his guard:<br/>

He put by SIDROPHELLO'S thrust,<br/>

And in right manfully he rusht;                              1060<br/>

The weapon from his gripe he wrung,<br/>

And laid him on the earth along.<br/>

WHACHUM his sea-coal prong threw by,<br/>

And basely turn'd his back to fly<br/>

But HUDIBRAS gave him a twitch                               1065<br/>

As quick as light'ning in the breech,<br/>

Just in the place where honour's lodg'd,<br/>

As wise philosophers have judg'd;<br/>

Because a kick in that place more<br/>

Hurts honour than deep wounds before.                        1070<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, The stars determine<br/>

You are my prisoners, base vermine!<br/>

Could they not tell you so as well<br/>

As what I came to know foretell?<br/>

By this what cheats you are we find,                         1075<br/>

That in your own concerns are blind.<br/>

Your lives are now at my dispose,<br/>

To be redeem'd by fine or blows:<br/>

But who his honour wou'd defile,<br/>

To take or sell two lives so vile?                           1080<br/>

I'll give you quarter; but your pillage,<br/>

The conq'ring warrior's crop and tillage,<br/>

Which with his sword he reaps and plows,<br/>

That's mine, the law of arms allows.<br/>
</p>

<p>This said, in haste, in haste he fell                        1085<br/>

To rummaging of SIDROPHEL.<br/>

First, he expounded both his pockets,<br/>

And found a watch, with rings and lockets,<br/>

Which had been left with him t' erect<br/>

A figure for, and so detect;                                 1090<br/>

A copper-plate, with almanacks<br/>

Engrav'd upon't; with other knacks,<br/>

Of BOOKER's LILLY's, SARAH JIMMERS',<br/>

And blank-schemes to discover nimmers;<br/>

A moon-dial, with Napier's bones,                            1095<br/>

And sev'ral constellation stones,<br/>

Engrav'd in planetary hours,<br/>

That over mortals had strange powers<br/>

To make 'em thrive in law or trade,<br/>

And stab or poison to evade;                                 1100<br/>

In wit or wisdom to improve,<br/>

And be victorious in love,<br/>

WHACHUM had neither cross nor pile;<br/>

His plunder was not worth the while;<br/>

All which the conq'rer did discompt,                         1105<br/>

To pay for curing of his rump.<br/>

But SIDROPHEL, as full of tricks<br/>

As Rota-men of politicks,<br/>

Straight cast about to over-reach<br/>

Th' unwary conqu'ror with a fetch,                           1110<br/>

And make him clad (at least) to quit<br/>

His victory, and fly the pit,<br/>

Before the Secular Prince of Darkness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-134" id="noteref-134" epub:type="noteref">134</a><br/>

Arriv'd to seize upon his carcass?<br/>

And as a fox, with hot pursuit                               1115<br/>

Chac'd thro' a warren, casts about<br/>

To save his credit, and among<br/>

Dead vermin on a gallows hung,<br/>

And while the dogs run underneath,<br/>

Escap'd (by counterfeiting death)                            1120<br/>

Not out of cunning, but a train<br/>

Of atoms justling in his brain,<br/>

As learn'd philosophers give out,<br/>

So SIDROPHELLO cast about,<br/>

And fell to's wonted trade again,                            1125<br/>

To feign himself in earnest slain:<br/>

First stretch'd out one leg, than another,<br/>

And seeming in his breath to smother<br/>

A broken sigh; quoth he, Where am I,<br/>

Alive or dead? or which way came I,                          1130<br/>

Through so immense a space so soon<br/>

But now I thought myself in th' Moon<br/>

And that a monster with huge whiskers,<br/>

More formidable than a Switzer's,<br/>

My body through and through had drill'd,                     1135<br/>

And WHACHUM by my side had kill'd:<br/>

Had cross-examin'd both our hose,<br/>

And plunder'd all we had to lose.<br/>

Look, there he is; I see him now,<br/>

And feel the place I am run through:                         1140<br/>

And there lies WHACHUM by my side<br/>

Stone dead, and in his own blood dy'd.<br/>

Oh! Oh! with that he fetch'd a groan,<br/>

And fell again into a swoon;<br/>

Shut both his eyes, and stopp'd his breath,                  1145<br/>

And to the life out-acted death;<br/>

That HUDIBRAS, to all appearing,<br/>

Believ'd him to be dead as herring.<br/>

He held it now no longer safe<br/>

To tarry the return of RALPH,                                1150<br/>

But rather leave him in the lurch:<br/>

Thought he, he has abus'd our Church,<br/>

Refus'd to give himself one firk<br/>

To carry on the publick work;<br/>

Despis'd our Synod-men like dirt,                            1155<br/>

And made their discipline his sport;<br/>

Divulg'd the secrets of their classes,<br/>

And their conventions prov'd high places;<br/>

Disparag'd their tythe-pigs as Pagan,<br/>

And set at nought their cheese and bacon;                    1160<br/>

Rail'd at their Covenant, and jeer'd<br/>

Their rev'rend parsons to my beard:<br/>

For all which scandals, to be quit<br/>

At once, this juncture falls out fit,<br/>

I'll make him henceforth to beware,                          1165<br/>

And tempt my fury, if he dare.<br/>

He must at least hold up his hand,<br/>

By twelve freeholders to be scann'd;<br/>

Who, by their skill in palmistry,<br/>

Will quickly read his destiny;                               1170<br/>

And make him glad to read his lesson,<br/>

Or take a turn for it at the session;<br/>

Unless his Light and Gifts prove truer<br/>

Then ever yet they did, I'm sure;<br/>

For if he scape with whipping now,                           1175<br/>

'Tis more than he can hope to do;<br/>

And that will disengage my conscience<br/>

Of th' obligation in his own sense,<br/>

I'll make him now by force abide<br/>

What he by gentle means deny'd,                              1180<br/>

To give my honour satisfaction,<br/>

And right the Brethren in the action.<br/>

This being resolv'd, with equal speed<br/>

And conduct he approach'd his steed,<br/>

And with activity unwont,                                    1185<br/>

Assay'd the lofty beast to mount;<br/>

Which once atchiev'd, he spurr'd his palfrey,<br/>

To get from th' enemy, and RALPH, free<br/>

Left dangers, fears, and foes behind,<br/>

And beat, at least three lengths, the wind.                  1190<br/>
