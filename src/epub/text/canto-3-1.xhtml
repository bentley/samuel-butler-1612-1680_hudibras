<p>'Tis true, no lover has that pow'r<br/>

T' enforce a desperate amour,<br/>

As he that has two strings t' his bow,<br/>

And burns for love and money too;<br/>

For then he's brave and resolute,                               5<br/>

Disdains to render in his suit,<br/>

Has all his flames and raptures double,<br/>

And hangs or drowns with half the trouble,<br/>

While those who sillily pursue,<br/>

The simple, downright way, and true,                           10<br/>

Make as unlucky applications,<br/>

And steer against the stream their passions.<br/>

Some forge their mistresses of stars,<br/>

And when the ladies prove averse,<br/>

And more untoward to be won                                15<br/>

Than by CALIGULA the Moon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-135" id="noteref-135" epub:type="noteref">135</a><br/>

Cry out upon the stars, for doing<br/>

Ill offices to cross their wooing;<br/>

When only by themselves they're hindred,<br/>

For trusting those they made her kindred;                      20<br/>

And still, the harsher and hide-bounder<br/>

The damsels prove, become the fonder.<br/>

For what mad lover ever dy'd<br/>

To gain a soft and gentle bride?<br/>

Or for a lady tender-hearted,                                  25<br/>

In purling streams or hemp departed?<br/>

Leap'd headlong int' Elysium,<br/>

Through th' windows of a dazzling room?<br/>

But for some cross, ill-natur'd dame,<br/>

The am'rous fly burnt in his flame.                            30<br/>

This to the Knight could be no news,<br/>

With all mankind so much in use;<br/>

Who therefore took the wiser course,<br/>

To make the most of his amours,<br/>

Resolv'd to try all sorts of ways,                             35<br/>

As follows in due time and place<br/>
</p>

<p>No sooner was the bloody fight,<br/>

Between the Wizard, and the Knight,<br/>

With all th' appurtenances, over,<br/>

But he relaps'd again t' a lover;                              40<br/>

As he was always wont to do,<br/>

When h' had discomfited a foe<br/>

And us'd the only antique philters,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-136" id="noteref-136" epub:type="noteref">136</a><br/>

Deriv'd from old heroic tilters.<br/>

But now triumphant, and victorious,                            45<br/>

He held th' atchievement was too glorious<br/>

For such a conqueror to meddle<br/>

With petty constable or beadle,<br/>

Or fly for refuge to the Hostess<br/>

Of th' Inns of Court and Chancery, Justice,<br/>

Who might, perhaps reduce his cause                            50<br/>

To th' ordeal trial of the laws,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-137" id="noteref-137" epub:type="noteref">137</a><br/>

Where none escape, but such as branded<br/>

With red-hot irons have past bare-handed;<br/>

And, if they cannot read one verse<br/>

I' th' Psalms, must sing it, and that's worse.                 55<br/>

He therefore judging it below him,<br/>

To tempt a shame the Devil might owe him,<br/>

Resolv'd to leave the Squire for bail<br/>

And mainprize for him to the gaol,<br/>

To answer, with his vessel, all,                               60<br/>

That might disastrously befall;<br/>

And thought it now the fittest juncture<br/>

To give the Lady a rencounter,<br/>

T' acquaint her 'with his expedition,                          65<br/>

And conquest o'er the fierce Magician;<br/>

Describe the manner of the fray,<br/>

And show the spoils he brought away,<br/>

His bloody scourging aggravate,<br/>

The number of his blows, and weight,                           70<br/>

All which might probably succeed,<br/>

And gain belief h' had done the deed,<br/>

Which he resolv'd t' enforce, and spare<br/>

No pawning of his soul to swear,<br/>

But, rather than produce his back,                             75<br/>

To set his conscience on the rack,<br/>

And in pursuance of his urging<br/>

Of articles perform'd and scourging,<br/>

And all things else, his part,<br/>

Demand deliv'ry of her heart,                                  80<br/>

Her goods, and chattels, and good graces,<br/>

And person up to his embraces.<br/>

Thought he, the ancient errant knights<br/>

Won all their ladies hearts in fights;<br/>

And cut whole giants into fritters,                            85<br/>

To put them into amorous twitters<br/>

Whose stubborn bowels scorn'd to yield<br/>

Until their gallants were half kill'd<br/>

But when their bones were drub'd so sore<br/>

They durst not woo one combat more,                            90<br/>

The ladies hearts began to melt,<br/>

Subdu'd by blows their lovers felt.<br/>

So Spanish heroes, with their lances,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-138" id="noteref-138" epub:type="noteref">138</a><br/>

At once wound bulls and ladies' fancies;<br/>

And he acquires the noblest spouse                             95<br/>

That widows greatest herds of cows:<br/>

Then what may I expect to do,<br/>

Wh' have quell'd so vast a buffalo?<br/>
</p>

<p>Mean while, the Squire was on his way<br/>

The Knight's late orders to obey;                             100<br/>

Who sent him for a strong detachment<br/>

Of beadles, constables, and watchmen,<br/>

T' attack the cunning-man fur plunder,<br/>

Committed falsely on his lumber;<br/>

When he, who had so lately sack'd                             105<br/>

The enemy, had done the fact;<br/>

Had rifled all his pokes and fobs<br/>

Of gimcracks, whims, and jiggumbobs,<br/>

When he, by hook or crook, had gather'd,<br/>

And for his own inventions father'd                           110<br/>

And when they should, at gaol delivery,<br/>

Unriddle one another's thievery,<br/>

Both might have evidence enough,<br/>

To render neither halter proof.<br/>

He thought it desperate to tarry,                             115<br/>

And venture to be accessary<br/>

But rather wisely slip his fetters,<br/>

And leave them for the Knight, his betters.<br/>

He call'd to mind th' unjust, foul play<br/>

He wou'd have offer'd him that day,                           120<br/>

To make him curry his own hide,<br/>

Which no beast ever did beside,<br/>

Without all possible evasion,<br/>

But of the riding dispensation;<br/>

And therefore much about the hour                             125<br/>

The Knight (for reasons told before)<br/>

Resolv'd to leave them to the fury<br/>

Of Justice, and an unpack'd Jury,<br/>

The Squire concurr'd t' abandon him,<br/>

And serve him in the self-same trim;                          130<br/>

T' acquaint the Lady what h' had done,<br/>

And what he meant to carry on;<br/>

What project 'twas he went about,<br/>

When SIDROPHEL and he fell out;<br/>

His firm and stedfast Resolution,                             135<br/>

To swear her to an execution;<br/>

To pawn his inward ears to marry her,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-139" id="noteref-139" epub:type="noteref">139</a><br/>

And bribe the Devil himself to carry her;<br/>

In which both dealt, as if they meant<br/>

Their Party-Saints to represent,                              140<br/>

Who never fail'd upon their sharing<br/>

In any prosperous arms-bearing<br/>

To lay themselves out to supplant<br/>

Each other Cousin-German Saint.<br/>

But, ere the Knight could do his part,                        145<br/>

The Squire had got so much the start,<br/>

H' had to the Lady done his errand,<br/>

And told her all his tricks afore-hand.<br/>

Just as he finish'd his report,<br/>

The Knight alighted in the court;                             150<br/>

And having ty'd his beast t' a pale,<br/>

And taking time for both to stale,<br/>

He put his band and beard in order,<br/>

The sprucer to accost and board her;<br/>

And now began t' approach the door,                           155<br/>

When she, wh' had spy'd him out before<br/>

Convey'd th' informer out of sight,<br/>

And went to entertain the Knight<br/>

With whom encount'ring, after longees<br/>

Of humble and submissive congees,                             160<br/>

And all due ceremonies paid,<br/>

He strok'd his beard, and thus he said:<br/>
</p>

<p>Madam, I do, as is my duty,<br/>

Honour the shadow of your shoe-tye;<br/>

And now am come to bring your ear                             165<br/>

A present you'll be glad to hear:<br/>

At least I hope so: the thing's done,<br/>

Or may I never see the sun;<br/>

For which I humbly now demand<br/>

Performance at your gentle hand                               170<br/>

And that you'd please to do your part,<br/>

As I have done mine, to my smart.<br/>
</p>

<p>With that he shrugg'd his sturdy back<br/>

As if he felt his shoulders ake.<br/>
</p>

<p>But she, who well enough knew what                            175<br/>

(Before he spoke) he would be at,<br/>

Pretended not to apprehend<br/>

The mystery of what he mean'd;.<br/>

And therefore wish'd him to expound<br/>

His dark expressions, less profound.                          180<br/>
</p>

<p>Madam, quoth he, I come to prove<br/>

How much I've suffer'd for your love,<br/>

Which (like your votary) to win,<br/>

I have not spar'd my tatter'd skin<br/>

And for those meritorious lashes,                             185<br/>

To claim your favour and good graces.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth she, I do remember once<br/>

I freed you from th' inchanted sconce;<br/>

And that you promis'd, for that favour,<br/>

To bind your back to good behaviour,                          190<br/>

And, for my sake and service, vow'd<br/>

To lay upon't a heavy load,<br/>

And what 'twould bear t' a scruple prove,<br/>

As other Knights do oft make love<br/>

Which, whether you have done or no,                           195<br/>

Concerns yourself, not me, to know.<br/>

But if you have, I shall confess,<br/>

Y' are honester than I could guess.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, if you suspect my troth,<br/>

I cannot prove it but by oath;                                200<br/>

And  if you make a question on't,<br/>

I'll pawn my soul that I have done't;<br/>

And he that makes his soul his surety,<br/>

I think, does give the best security.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth she, Some say, the soul's secure                        205<br/>

Against distress and forfeiture<br/>

Is free from action, and exempt<br/>

From execution and contempt;<br/>

And to be summon'd to appear<br/>

In th' other world's illegal here;                            210<br/>

And therefore few make any account<br/>

Int' what incumbrances they run't<br/>

For most men carry things so even<br/>

Between this World, and Hell, and Heaven,<br/>

Without the least offence to either,                          215<br/>

They freely deal in all together;<br/>

And equally abhor to quit<br/>

This world for both or both for it;<br/>

And when they pawn and damn their souls,<br/>

They are but pris'ners on paroles.                            220<br/>
</p>

<p>For that (quoth he) 'tis rational,<br/>

Th' may be accountable in all:<br/>

For when there is that intercourse<br/>

Between divine and human pow'rs,<br/>

That all that we determine here                               225<br/>

Commands obedience every where,<br/>

When penalties may be commuted<br/>

For fines or ears, and executed<br/>

It follows, nothing binds so fast<br/>

As souls in pawn and mortgage past                            230<br/>

For oaths are th' only tests and seals<br/>

Of right and wrong, and true and false,<br/>

And there's no other way to try<br/>

The doubts of law and justice by.<br/>
</p>

<p>(Quoth she) What is it you would swear                        235<br/>

There's no believing till I hear<br/>

For, till they're understood all tales<br/>

(Like nonsense) are not true nor false.<br/>
</p>

<p>(Quoth he) When I resolv'd t' obey<br/>

What you commanded th' other day,                             240<br/>

And to perform my exercise,<br/>

(As schools are wont) for your fair eyes,<br/>

T' avoid all scruples in the case,<br/>

I went to do't upon the place.<br/>

But as the Castle is inchanted                                245<br/>

By SIDROPHEL the Witch and haunted<br/>

By evil spirits, as you know,<br/>

Who took my Squire and me for two,<br/>

Before I'd hardly time to lay<br/>

My weapons by, and disarray                                   250<br/>

I heard a formidable noise,<br/>

Loud as the Stentrophonick voice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-140" id="noteref-140" epub:type="noteref">140</a><br/>

That roar'd far off, Dispatch and strip,<br/>

I'm ready with th' infernal whip,<br/>

That shall divest thy ribs from skin,                         255<br/>

To expiate thy ling'ring sin.<br/>

Th' hast broken perfidiously thy oath,<br/>

And not perform'd thy plighted troth;<br/>

But spar'd thy renegado back,<br/>

Where th' hadst so great a prize at stake;                    260<br/>

Which now the fates have order'd me<br/>

For penance and revenge to flea,<br/>

Unless thou presently make haste:<br/>

Time is, time was: And there it ceas'd.<br/>

With which, though startled, I confess,                       265<br/>

Yet th' horror of the thing was less<br/>

Than th' other dismal apprehension<br/>

Of interruption or prevention;<br/>

And therefore, snatching up the rod,<br/>

I laid upon my back a load;                                   270<br/>

Resolv'd to spare no flesh and blood,<br/>

To make my word and honour good;<br/>

Till tir'd, and making truce at length,<br/>

For new recruits of breath and strength,<br/>

I felt the blows still ply'd as fast                          275<br/>

As th' had been by lovers plac'd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-141" id="noteref-141" epub:type="noteref">141</a><br/>

In raptures of platonick lashing,<br/>

And chaste contemplative bardashing;<br/>

When facing hastily about,<br/>

To stand upon my guard and scout,                             280<br/>

I found th' infernal Cunning-man,<br/>

And th' under-witch, his CALIBAN,<br/>

With scourges (like the Furies) arm'd,<br/>

That on my outward quarters storm'd.<br/>

In haste I snatch'd my weapon up,                             285<br/>

And gave their hellish rage a stop;<br/>

Call'd thrice upon your name, and fell<br/>

Courageously on SIDROPHEL;<br/>

Who, now transform'd himself a bear,<br/>

Began to roar aloud, and tear;                                290<br/>

When I as furiously press'd on,<br/>

My weapon down his throat to run;<br/>

Laid hold on him; but he broke loose,<br/>

And turn'd himself into a goose;<br/>

Div'd under water, in a pond,                                 295<br/>

To hide himself from being found.<br/>

In vain I sought him; but, as soon<br/>

As I perceiv'd him fled and gone,<br/>

Prepar'd with equal haste and rage,<br/>

His Under-sorcerer t' engage.                                 300<br/>

But bravely scorning to defile<br/>

My sword with feeble blood and vile,<br/>

I judg'd it better from a quick-<br/>

Set hedge to cut a knotted stick,<br/>

With which I furiously laid on                                305<br/>

Till, in a harsh and doleful tone,<br/>

It roar'd, O hold for pity, Sir<br/>

I am too great a sufferer,<br/>

Abus'd, as you have been, b' a witch,<br/>

But conjur'd into a worse caprich;                            310<br/>

Who sends me out on many a jaunt,<br/>

Old houses in the night to haunt,<br/>

For opportunities t' improve<br/>

Designs of thievery or love;<br/>

With drugs convey'd in drink or meat,                         315<br/>

All teats of witches counterfeit;<br/>

Kill pigs and geese with powder'd glass,<br/>

And make it for enchantment pass;<br/>

With cow-itch meazle like a leper,<br/>

And choak with fumes of guiney pepper;                        320<br/>

Make leachers and their punks with dewtry,<br/>

Commit fantastical advowtry;<br/>

Bewitch Hermetick-men to run<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-142" id="noteref-142" epub:type="noteref">142</a><br/>

Stark staring mad with manicon;<br/>

Believe mechanick Virtuosi                                    325<br/>

Can raise 'em mountains in POTOSI;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-143" id="noteref-143" epub:type="noteref">143</a><br/>

And, sillier than the antick fools,<br/>

Take treasure for a heap of coals:<br/>

Seek out for plants with signatures,<br/>

To quack of universal cures:                                  330<br/>

With figures ground on panes of glass<br/>

Make people on their heads to pass;<br/>

And mighty heaps of coin increase,<br/>

Reflected from a single piece,<br/>

To draw in fools, whose nat'ral itches                        335<br/>

Incline perpetually to witches;<br/>

And keep me in continual fears,<br/>

And danger of my neck and ears;<br/>

When less delinquents have been scourg'd,<br/>

And hemp on wooden anvil forg'd,                              340<br/>

Which others for cravats have worn<br/>

About their necks, and took a turn.<br/>
</p>

<p>I pity'd the sad punishment<br/>

The wretched caitiff underwent,<br/>

And left my drubbing of his bones,                            345<br/>

Too great an honour for pultrones;<br/>

For Knights are bound to feel no blows<br/>

From paultry and unequal foes,<br/>

Who, when they slash, and cut to pieces,<br/>

Do all with civilest addresses:                               350<br/>

Their horses never give a blow,<br/>

But when they make a leg, and bow.<br/>

I therefore spar'd his flesh, and prest him<br/>

About the witch with many a. question.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, For many years he drove                             355<br/>

A kind of broking-trade in love;<br/>

Employ'd in all th' intrigues, and trust<br/>

Of feeble, speculative lust:<br/>

Procurer to th' extravagancy,<br/>

And crazy ribaldry of fancy,                                  360<br/>

By those the Devil had forsook,<br/>

As things below him to provoke.<br/>

But b'ing a virtuoso, able<br/>

To smatter, quack, and cant, and dabble,<br/>

He held his talent most adroit                                365<br/>

For any mystical exploit;<br/>

As others of his tribe had done,<br/>

And rais'd their prices three to one:<br/>

For one predicting pimp has th' odds<br/>

Of chauldrons of plain downright bawds.                       370<br/>

But as an elf (the Devil's valet)<br/>

Is not so slight a thing to get;<br/>

For those that do his bus'ness best,<br/>

In hell are us'd the ruggedest;<br/>

Before so meriting a person                                   375<br/>

Cou'd get a grant, but in reversion,<br/>

He serv'd two prenticeships, and longer,<br/>

I' th' myst'ry of a lady-monger.<br/>

For (as some write) a witch's ghost,<br/>

As soon as from the body loos'd,                              380<br/>

Becomes a puney-imp itself<br/>

And is another witch's elf.<br/>

He, after searching far and near,<br/>

At length found one in LANCASHIRE<br/>

With whom he bargain'd before-hand,                           385<br/>

And, after hanging, entertained;<br/>

Since which h' has play'd a thousand feats,<br/>

And practis'd all mechanick cheats,<br/>

Transform'd himself to th' ugly shapes<br/>

Of wolves and bears, baboons and apes,                        390<br/>

Which he has vary'd more than witches,<br/>

Or Pharaoh's wizards cou'd their switches;<br/>

And all with whom h' has had to do,<br/>

Turn'd to as monstrous figures too.<br/>

Witness myself, whom h' has abus'd,                           395<br/>

And to this beastly shape reduc'd,<br/>

By feeding me on beans and pease,<br/>

He crams in nasty crevices,<br/>

And turns to comfits by his arts,<br/>

To make me relish for disserts,                               400<br/>

And one by one, with shame and fear,<br/>

Lick up the candy'd provender.<br/>

Beside — But as h' was running on,<br/>

To tell what other feats h' had done,<br/>

The Lady stopt his full career,                               405<br/>

And told him now 'twas time to hear<br/>

If half those things (said she) be true —<br/>

They're all, (quoth he,) I swear by you.<br/>

Why then (said she,) That SIDROPHEL<br/>

Has damn'd himself to th' pit of Hell;                        410<br/>

Who, mounted on a broom, the nag<br/>

And hackney of a Lapland hag,<br/>

In quest of you came hither post,<br/>

Within an hour (I'm sure) at most;<br/>

Who told me all you swear and say,                            415<br/>

Quite contrary another way;<br/>

Vow'd that you came to him to know<br/>

If you should carry me or no;<br/>

And would have hir'd him, and his imps,<br/>

To be your match-makers and pimps,                            420<br/>

T' engage the Devil on. your side,<br/>

And steal (like PROSERPINE) your bride.<br/>

But he, disdaining to embrace.<br/>

So filthy a design and base,<br/>

You fell to vapouring and huffing                             425<br/>

And drew upon him like a ruffin;<br/>

Surpriz'd him meanly, unprepar'd,<br/>

Before h' had time to mount his guard;<br/>

And left him dead upon the ground,<br/>

With many a bruise and desperate wound:                       430<br/>

Swore you had broke and robb'd his house,<br/>

And stole his talismanique louse,<br/>

And all his new-found old inventions;.<br/>

With flat felonious intentions;<br/>

Which he could bring out where he had,                        435<br/>

And what he bought them for, and paid.<br/>

His flea, his morpion, and punese,<br/>

H' had gotten for his proper ease,<br/>

And all perfect minutes made,<br/>

By th' ablest artist of the trade;                            440<br/>

Which (he could prove it) since he lost,<br/>

He has been eaten up almost;<br/>

And all together might amount<br/>

To many hundreds on account;<br/>

For which h' had got sufficient warrant                       445<br/>

To seize the malefactors errant,<br/>

Without capacity of bail,<br/>

But of a cart's or horse's tail;<br/>

And did not doubt to bring the wretches<br/>

To serve for pendulums to watches;                            450<br/>

Which, modern virtuosos say,<br/>

Incline to hanging every way.<br/>

Beside, he swore, and swore 'twas true,<br/>

That, e're he went in quest of you,<br/>

He set a figure to discover                                   455<br/>

If you were fled to RYE or DOVER;<br/>

And found it clear, that, to betray<br/>

Yourselves and me, you fled this way;<br/>

And that he was upon pursuit,<br/>

To take you somewhere hereabout.                              460<br/>

He vow' d he had intelligence<br/>

Of all that past before and since;<br/>

And found that, e'er you came to him,.<br/>

Y' had been engaging life and limb<br/>

About a case of tender conscience,                            465<br/>

Where both abounded in your own sense:<br/>

Till RALPHO, by his light and grace,<br/>

Had clear'd all scruples in the case;<br/>

And prov'd that you might swear and own<br/>

Whatever's by the wicked done,                                470<br/>

For which, most basely to requite<br/>

The service of his gifts and light,<br/>

You strove to oblige him, by main force,<br/>

To scourge his ribs instead of yours;<br/>

But that he stood upon his guard,                             475<br/>

And all your vapouring out-dar'd;<br/>

For which, between you both, the feat<br/>

Has never been perform'd as yet.<br/>
</p>

<p>While thus the Lady talk'd, the Knight<br/>

Turn'd th' outside of his eyes to white;                      480<br/>

(As men of inward light are wont<br/>

To  turn their opticks in upon 't)<br/>

He wonder'd  how she came to know<br/>

What he had done, and meant to do;<br/>

Held up his affidavit-hand,                                   485<br/>

As if h' had been to be arraign'd;<br/>

Cast t'wards the door a look,<br/>

In dread of SIDROPHEL, and spoke:<br/>
</p>

<p>Madam, if but one word be true<br/>

Of all the Wizard has told you,                               490<br/>

Or but one single circumstance<br/>

In all th' apocryphal romance,<br/>

May dreadful earthquakes swallow down<br/>

This vessel, that is all your own;<br/>

Or may the heavens fall, and cover                            495<br/>

These reliques of your constant lover.<br/>
</p>

<p>You have provided well, quoth she,<br/>

(I thank you) for yourself and me,<br/>

And shown your presbyterian wits<br/>

Jump punctual with the Jesuits;                               500<br/>

A most compendious way, and civil,<br/>

At once to cheat the world, the Devil,<br/>

And Heaven and Hell, yourselves, and those<br/>

On whom you vainly think t' impose.<br/>

Why then (quoth he) may Hell surprize —                      505<br/>

That trick (said she) will not pass twice:<br/>

I've learn'd how far I'm to believe<br/>

Your pinning oaths upon your sleeve.<br/>

But there's a better way of clearing<br/>

What you would prove than downright swearing:                 510<br/>

For if you have perform'd the feat,<br/>

The blows are visible as yet,<br/>

Enough to serve for satisfaction<br/>

Of nicest scruples in the action:<br/>

And if you can produce those knobs,                           515<br/>

Although they're but the witch's drubs,<br/>

I'll pass them all upon account,<br/>

As if your natural self had done't<br/>

Provided that they pass th' opinion<br/>

Of able juries of old women                                   520<br/>

Who, us'd to judge all matter of facts<br/>

For bellies, may do so for backs,<br/>
</p>

<p>Madam, (quoth he,) your love's a million;<br/>

To do is less than to be willing,<br/>

As I am, were it in my power,                                 525<br/>

T' obey, what you command, and more:<br/>

But for performing what you bid,<br/>

I thank you as much as if I did.<br/>

You know I ought to have a care<br/>

To keep my wounds from taking air:                            530<br/>

For wounds in those that are all heart,<br/>

Are dangerous in any part.<br/>
</p>

<p>I find (quoth she) my goods and chattels<br/>

Are like to prove but mere drawn battels;<br/>

For still the longer we contend,                              535<br/>

We are but farther off the end.<br/>

But granting now we should agree,<br/>

What is it you expect from me?<br/>

Your plighted faith (quoth he) and word<br/>

You past in heaven on record,                                 540<br/>

Where all contracts, to have and t' hold,<br/>

Are everlastingly enroll'd:<br/>

And if 'tis counted treason here<br/>

To raze records, 'tis much more there.<br/>

Quoth she, There are no bargains driv'n,                      545<br/>

Or marriages clapp'd up, in Heav'n,<br/>

And that's the reason, as some guess,<br/>

There is no heav'n in marriages;<br/>

Two things that naturally press<br/>

Too narrowly to be at ease.                                   550<br/>

Their bus'ness there is only love,<br/>

Which marriage is not like t' improve:<br/>

Love, that's too generous to abide<br/>

To be against its nature ty'd;<br/>

Or where 'tis of itself inclin'd,                             555<br/>

It breaks loose when it is confin'd;<br/>

And like the soul, it's harbourer.<br/>

Debarr'd the freedom of the air,<br/>

Disdains against its will to stay,<br/>

But struggles out, and flies away;                            560<br/>

And therefore never can comply<br/>

To endure the matrimonial tie,<br/>

That binds the female and the male,<br/>

Where th' one is but the other's bail;<br/>

Like Roman gaolers, when they slept,                          565<br/>

Chain'd to the prisoners they kept<br/>

Of which the true and faithfull'st lover<br/>

Gives best security to suffer.<br/>

Marriage is but a beast, some say,<br/>

That carries double in foul way;                              570<br/>

And therefore 'tis not to b' admir'd,<br/>

It should so suddenly be tir'd;<br/>

A bargain at a venture made,<br/>

Between two partners in a trade;<br/>

(For what's inferr'd by t' have and t' hold,                  575<br/>

But something past away, and sold?)<br/>

That as it makes but one of two,<br/>

Reduces all things else as low;<br/>

And, at the best, is but a mart<br/>

Between the one and th' other part,                           580<br/>

That on the marriage-day is paid,<br/>

Or hour of death, the bet is laid;<br/>

And all the rest of better or worse,<br/>

Both are but losers out of purse.<br/>

For when upon their ungot heirs                               585<br/>

Th' entail themselves, and all that's theirs,<br/>

What blinder bargain e'er was driv'n,<br/>

Or wager laid at six and seven?<br/>

To pass themselves away, and turn<br/>

Their childrens' tenants e're they're born?                   590<br/>

Beg one another idiot<br/>

To guardians, e'er they are begot;<br/>

Or ever shall, perhaps, by th' one,<br/>

Who's bound to vouch 'em for his own,<br/>

Though got b' implicit generation,                            595<br/>

And gen'ral club of all the nation;<br/>

For which she's fortify'd no less<br/>

Than all the island, with four seas;<br/>

Exacts the tribute of her dower,<br/>

in ready insolence and power;                                 600<br/>

And makes him pass away to have<br/>

And hold, to her, himself, her slave,<br/>

More wretched than an ancient villain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-144" id="noteref-144" epub:type="noteref">144</a><br/>

Condemn'd to drudgery and tilling;<br/>

While all he does upon the by,                                605<br/>

She is not bound to justify,<br/>

Nor at her proper cost and charge<br/>

Maintain the feats he does at large.<br/>

Such hideous sots were those obedient<br/>

Old vassals to their ladies regent;                           610<br/>

To give the cheats the eldest hand<br/>

In foul play by the laws o' th' land;<br/>

For which so many a legal cuckold<br/>

Has been run down in courts and truckeld:<br/>

A law that most unjustly yokes                                615<br/>

All Johns of Stiles to Joans of Nokes,<br/>

Without distinction of degree,<br/>

Condition, age, or quality:<br/>

Admits no power of revocation,<br/>

Nor valuable consideration,                                   620<br/>

Nor writ of error, nor reverse<br/>

Of Judgment past, for better or worse:<br/>

Will not allow the priviledges<br/>

That beggars challenge under hedges,<br/>

Who, when they're griev'd, can make dead horses               625<br/>

Their spiritual judges of divorces;<br/>

While nothing else but Rem in Re<br/>

Can set the proudest wretches free;<br/>

A slavery beyond enduring,<br/>

But that 'tis of their own procuring.                         630<br/>

As spiders never seek the fly,<br/>

But leave him, of himself, t' apply<br/>

So men are by themselves employ'd,<br/>

To quit the freedom they enjoy'd,<br/>

And run their necks into a noose,                             635<br/>

They'd break 'em after, to break loose;<br/>

As some whom Death would not depart,<br/>

Have done the feat themselves by art;<br/>

Like Indian widows, gone to bed<br/>

In flaming curtains to the dead;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-145" id="noteref-145" epub:type="noteref">145</a>                              640<br/>

And men as often dangled for't,<br/>

And yet will never leave the sport.<br/>

Nor do the ladies want excuse<br/>

For all the stratagems they use<br/>

To gain the advantage of the set,                             645<br/>

And lurch the amorous rook and cheat<br/>

For as the Pythagorean soul<br/>

Runs through all beasts, and fish and fowl,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-146" id="noteref-146" epub:type="noteref">146</a><br/>

And has a smack of ev'ry one,<br/>

So love does, and has ever done;                              650<br/>

And therefore, though 'tis ne'er so fond,<br/>

Takes strangely to the vagabond.<br/>

'Tis but an ague that's reverst,<br/>

Whose hot fit takes the patient first,<br/>

That after burns with cold as much                            655<br/>

As ir'n in GREENLAND does the touch;<br/>

Melts in the furnace of desire<br/>

Like glass, that's but the ice of fire;<br/>

And when his heat of fancy's over,<br/>

Becomes as hard and frail a lover.                            660<br/>

For when he's with love-powder laden,<br/>

And prim'd and cock'd by Miss or Madam,<br/>

The smallest sparkle of an eye<br/>

Gives fire to his artillery;<br/>

And off the loud oaths go; but while                          665<br/>

They're in the very act, recoil.<br/>

Hence 'tis so few dare take their chance<br/>

Without a sep'rate maintenance;<br/>

And widows, who have try'd one lover,<br/>

Trust none again, 'till th' have made over;                   670<br/>

Or if they do, before they marry,<br/>

The foxes weigh the geese they carry;<br/>

And e're they venture o'er a stream,<br/>

Know how to size themselves and them;<br/>

Whence wittiest ladies always choose                          675<br/>

To undertake the heaviest goose<br/>

For now the world is grown so wary,<br/>

That few of either sex dare marry,<br/>

But rather trust on tick t' amours,<br/>

The cross and pile for better or worse;                       680<br/>

A mode that is held honourable,<br/>

As well as French, and fashionable:<br/>

For when it falls out for the best,<br/>

Where both are incommoded least,<br/>

In soul and body two unite,                                   685<br/>

To make up one hermaphrodite,<br/>

Still amorous, and fond, and billing,<br/>

Like PHILIP and MARY on a shilling,<br/>

Th' have more punctilios and capriches<br/>

Between the petticoat and breeches,                           690<br/>

More petulant extravagances,<br/>

Than poets make 'em in romances.<br/>

Though when their heroes 'spouse the dames,<br/>

We hear no more charms and flames:<br/>

For then their late attracts decline,                         695<br/>

And turn as eager as prick'd wine;<br/>

And all their catterwauling tricks,<br/>

In earnest to as jealous piques;<br/>

Which the ancients wisely signify'd,<br/>

By th' yellow mantos of the bride:                            700<br/>

For jealousy is but a kind<br/>

Of clap and grincam of the mind,<br/>

The natural effects of love,<br/>

As other flames and aches prove;<br/>

But all the mischief is, the doubt                            705<br/>

On whose account they first broke out.<br/>

For though Chineses go to bed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-147" id="noteref-147" epub:type="noteref">147</a><br/>

And lie in, in their ladies stead,<br/>

And for the pains they took before,<br/>

Are nurs'd and pamper'd to do more                            710<br/>

Our green men do it worse, when th' hap<br/>

To fail in labour of a clap<br/>

Both lay the child to one another:<br/>

But who's the father, who the mother,<br/>

'Tis hard to say in multitudes,                               715<br/>

Or who imported the French goods.<br/>

But health and sickness b'ing all one,<br/>

Which both engag'd before to own,<br/>

And are not with their bodies bound<br/>

To worship, only when they're sound,                          720<br/>

Both give and take their equal shares<br/>

Of all they suffer by false wares:<br/>

A fate no lover can divert<br/>

With all his caution, wit, and art.<br/>

For 'tis in vain to think to guess                            725<br/>

At women by appearances,<br/>

That paint and patch their imperfections<br/>

Of intellectual complexions,<br/>

And daub their tempers o'er with washes<br/>

As artificial as their faces;                                 730<br/>

Wear under vizard-masks their talents<br/>

And mother-wits before their gallants,<br/>

Until they're hamper'd in the noose,<br/>

Too fast to dream of breaking loose;<br/>

When all the flaws they strove to hide                        735<br/>

Are made unready with the bride,<br/>

That with her wedding-clothes undresses<br/>

Her complaisance and gentilesses,<br/>

Tries all her arts to take upon her<br/>

The government from th' easy owner;                           740<br/>

Until the wretch is glad to wave<br/>

His lawful right, and turn her slave;<br/>

Find all his having, and his holding,<br/>

Reduc'd t' eternal noise and scolding;<br/>

The conjugal petard, that tears                               745<br/>

Down all portcullises of ears,<br/>

And make the volley of one tongue<br/>

For all their leathern shields too strong<br/>

When only arm'd with noise and nails,<br/>

The female silk-worms ride the males,                         750<br/>

Transform 'em into rams and goats,<br/>

Like Sirens, with their charming notes;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-148" id="noteref-148" epub:type="noteref">148</a><br/>

Sweet as a screech-owl's serenade,<br/>

Or those enchanting murmurs made<br/>

By th' husband mandrake and the wife,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-149" id="noteref-149" epub:type="noteref">149</a>                     755<br/>

Both bury'd (like themselves) alive.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, These reasons are but strains<br/>

Of wanton, over-heated brains<br/>

Which ralliers, in their wit, or drink,<br/>

Do rather wheedle with than think                             760<br/>

Man was not man in paradise,<br/>

Until he was created twice,<br/>

And had his better half, his bride,<br/>

Carv'd from the original, his side,<br/>

T' amend his natural defects,                                 765<br/>

And perfect his recruited sex;<br/>

Inlarge his breed at once, and lessen<br/>

The pains and labour of increasing,<br/>

By changing them for other cares,<br/>

As by his dry'd-up paps appears.                              770<br/>

His body, that stupendous frame,<br/>

Of all the world the anagram<br/>

Is of two equal parts compact,<br/>

In shape and symmetry exact,<br/>

Of which the left and female side                             775<br/>

Is to the manly right a bride;<br/>

Both join'd together with such art,<br/>

That nothing else but death can part.<br/>

Those heav'nly attracts of yours, your eyes,<br/>

And face, that all the world surprize,                        780<br/>

That dazzle all that look upon ye,<br/>

And scorch all other ladies tawny,<br/>

Those ravishing and charming graces<br/>

Are all made up of two half faces,<br/>

That in a mathematick line,                                   785<br/>

Like those in other heavens, join,<br/>

Of which if either grew alone,<br/>

T' would fright as much to look upon:<br/>

And so would that sweet bud your lip,<br/>

Without the other's fellowship.                               790<br/>

Our noblest senses act by pairs;<br/>

Two eyes to see; to hear, two ears;<br/>

Th' intelligencers of the mind,<br/>

To wait upon the soul design'd,<br/>

But those that serve the body alone,                          795<br/>

Are single, and confin'd to one.<br/>

The world is but two parts, that meet<br/>

And close at th' equinoctial fit;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-150" id="noteref-150" epub:type="noteref">150</a><br/>

And so are all the works of nature,<br/>

Stamp'd with her signature on matter,                         800<br/>

Which all her creatures, to a leaf,<br/>

Or smallest blade of grass receive;<br/>

All which sufficiently declare,<br/>

How entirely marriage is her care,<br/>

The only method that she uses                                 805<br/>

In all the wonders she produces:<br/>

And those that take their rules from her,<br/>

Can never be deceiv'd, nor err.<br/>

For what secures the civil life,<br/>

But pawns of children, and a wife?                            810<br/>

That lie like hostages at stake,<br/>

To pay for all men undertake;<br/>

To whom it is as necessary<br/>

As to be born and breathe, to marry;<br/>

So universal all mankind,                                     815<br/>

In nothing else, is of one mind.<br/>

For in what stupid age, or nation,<br/>

Was marriage ever out of fashion?<br/>

Unless among the Amazons,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-151" id="noteref-151" epub:type="noteref">151</a><br/>

Or cloister'd friars, and vestal nuns;                        820<br/>

Or Stoicks, who to bar the freaks<br/>

And loose excesses of the sex,<br/>

Prepost'rously wou'd have all women<br/>

Turn'd up to all the world in common.<br/>

Though men would find such mortal feuds,                      825<br/>

In sharing of their publick goods,<br/>

'Twould put them to more charge of lives,<br/>

Than they're supply'd with now by wives;<br/>

Until they graze, and wear their clothes,<br/>

As beasts do, of their native growths:                        830<br/>

For simple wearing of their horns<br/>

Will not suffice to serve their turns.<br/>

For what can we pretend t' inherit,<br/>

Unless the marriage-deed will bear it?<br/>

Could claim no right, to lands or rents,                      835<br/>

But for our parents' settlements;<br/>

Had been but younger sons o' th' earth,<br/>

Debarr'd it all, but for our birth.<br/>

What honours or estates of peers,<br/>

Cou'd be preserv'd but by their heirs                         840<br/>

And what security maintains<br/>

Their right and title, but the banes?<br/>

What crowns could be hereditary,<br/>

If greatest monarchs did not marry.<br/>

And with their consorts consummate                            845<br/>

Their weightiest interests of state?<br/>

For all the amours of princes are<br/>

But guarantees of peace or war,<br/>

Or what but marriage has a charm<br/>

The rage of empires to disarm,                                850<br/>

Make blood and desolation cease,<br/>

And fire and sword unite in peace,<br/>

When all their fierce contest for forage<br/>

Conclude in articles of marriage?<br/>

Nor does the genial bed provide                               855<br/>

Less for the int'rests of the bride;<br/>

Who else had not the least pretence<br/>

T' as much as due benevolence;<br/>

Could no more title take upon her<br/>

To virtue, quality, and honour.                               860<br/>

Than ladies-errant, unconfin'd,<br/>

And feme-coverts t' all mankind<br/>

All women would be of one piece,<br/>

The virtuous matron and the miss;<br/>

The nymphs of chaste Diana's train,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-152" id="noteref-152" epub:type="noteref">152</a>                       865<br/>

The same with those in LEWKNER's Lane;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-153" id="noteref-153" epub:type="noteref">153</a><br/>

But for the difference marriage makes<br/>

'Twixt wives and ladies of the lakes;<br/>

Besides the joys of place and birth,<br/>

The sex's paradise on earth;                                  870<br/>

A privilege so sacred held,<br/>

That none will to their mothers yield;<br/>

But rather than not go before,<br/>

Abandon Heaven at the door.<br/>

And if th' indulgent law allows                               875<br/>

A greater freedom to the spouse,<br/>

The reason is, because the wife<br/>

Runs greater hazards of her life;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-154" id="noteref-154" epub:type="noteref">154</a><br/>

Is trusted with the form and matter<br/>

Of all mankind by careful nature;                             880<br/>

Where man brings nothing but the stuff<br/>

She frames the wond'rous fabric of;<br/>

Who therefore, in a streight, may freely<br/>

Demand the clergy of her belly,<br/>

And make it save her the same way                             885<br/>

It seldom misses to betray;<br/>

Unless both parties wisely enter<br/>

Into the liturgy indenture,<br/>

And though some fits of small contest<br/>

Sometimes fall out among the best,                            890<br/>

That is no more than ev'ry lover<br/>

Does from his hackney-lady suffer;<br/>

That makes no breach of faith and love,<br/>

But rather (sometimes) serves t' improve.<br/>

For as in running, ev'ry pace                                 895<br/>

Is but between two legs a race,<br/>

In which both do their uttermost<br/>

To get before, and win the post,<br/>

Yet when they're at their race's ends,<br/>

They're still as kind and constant friends,                   900<br/>

And, to relieve their weariness,<br/>

By turns give one another ease;<br/>

So all those false alarms of strife<br/>

Between the husband and the wife,<br/>

And little quarrels, often prove                              905<br/>

To be but new recruits of love;<br/>

When those wh' are always kind or coy,<br/>

In time must either tire or cloy.<br/>

Nor are their loudest clamours more,<br/>

Than as they're relish'd, sweet or sour;                      910<br/>

Like musick, that proves bad or good;<br/>

According as 'tis understood.<br/>

In all amours, a lover burns<br/>

With frowns as well as smiles by turns;<br/>

And hearts have been as aft with sullen                       915<br/>

As charming looks surpriz'd and stolen.<br/>

Then why should more bewitching clamour<br/>

Some lovers not as much enamour?<br/>

For discords make the sweetest airs<br/>

And curses are a kind of pray'rs;                             920<br/>

Too slight alloys for all those grand<br/>

Felicities by marriage gain'd.<br/>

For nothing else has pow'r to settle<br/>

Th' interests of love perpetual;<br/>

An act and deed, that that makes one heart                    925<br/>

Becomes another's counter-part,<br/>

And passes fines on faith and love,<br/>

Inroll'd and register'd above,<br/>

To seal the slippery knots of vows,<br/>

Which nothing else but death can loose.                       930<br/>

And what security's too strong,<br/>

To guard that gentle heart from wrong,<br/>

That to its friend is glad to pass<br/>

Itself away, and all it has;<br/>

And, like an anchorite, gives over                            935<br/>

This world for th' heaven of lover?<br/>

I grant (quoth she) there are some few<br/>

Who take that course, and find it true<br/>

But millions whom the same does sentence<br/>

To heav'n b' another way — repentance.                       940<br/>

Love's arrows are but shot at rovers;<br/>

Though all they hit, they turn to lovers;<br/>

And all the weighty consequents<br/>

Depend upon more blind events,<br/>

Than gamesters, when they play a set                          945<br/>

With greatest cunning at piquet,<br/>

Put out with caution, but take in<br/>

They know not what, unsight, unseen,<br/>

For what do lovers, when they're fast<br/>

In one another's arms embrac't,                               950<br/>

But strive to plunder, and convey<br/>

Each other, like a prize, away?<br/>

To change the property of selves,<br/>

As sucking children are by elves?<br/>

And if they use their persons so,                             955<br/>

What will they to their fortunes do?<br/>

Their fortunes! the perpetual aims<br/>

Of all their extasies and flames.<br/>

For when the money's on the book,<br/>

And, All my worldly goods — but spoke,                       960<br/>

(The formal livery and seisin<br/>

That puts a lover in possession,)<br/>

To that alone the bridegroom's wedded;<br/>

The bride a flam, that's superseded.<br/>

To that their faith is still made good,                       965<br/>

And all the oaths to us they vow'd:<br/>

For when we once resign our pow'rs,<br/>

W' have nothing left we can call ours:<br/>

Our money's now become the Miss<br/>

Of all your lives and services;                               970<br/>

And we forsaken, and postpon'd;<br/>

But bawds to what before we own'd;<br/>

Which, as it made y' at first gallant us,<br/>

So now hires others to supplant us,<br/>

Until 'tis all turn'd out of doors,                           975<br/>

(As we had been) for new amours;<br/>

For what did ever heiress yet<br/>

By being born to lordships get?<br/>

When the more lady sh' is of manours,<br/>

She's but expos'd to more trepanners,                         980<br/>

Pays for their projects and designs,<br/>

And for her own destruction fines;<br/>

And does but tempt them with her riches,<br/>

To use her as the Dev'l does witches;<br/>

Who takes it for a special grace                              985<br/>

To be their cully for a space,<br/>

That when the time's expir'd, the drazels<br/>

For ever may become his vassals:<br/>

So she, bewitch'd by rooks and spirits,<br/>

Betrays herself, and all sh' inherits;                        990<br/>

Is bought and sold, like stolen goods,<br/>

By pimps, and match-makers, and bawds,<br/>

Until they force her to convey,<br/>

And steal the thief himself away.<br/>

These are the everlasting fruits                              995<br/>

Of all your passionate love-suits,<br/>

Th' effects of all your amorous fancies<br/>

To portions and inheritances;<br/>

Your love-sick rapture for fruition<br/>

Of dowry, jointure, and tuition;                             1000<br/>

To which you make address and courtship;<br/>

Ad with your bodies strive to worship,<br/>

That th' infants' fortunes may partake<br/>

Of love too, for the mother's sake.<br/>

For these you play at purposes,                              1005<br/>

And love your love's with A's and B's:<br/>

For these at Beste and L'Ombre woo,<br/>

And play for love and money too;<br/>

Strive who shall be the ablest man<br/>

At right gallanting of a fan;                                1010<br/>

And who the most genteelly bred<br/>

At sucking of a vizard-head;<br/>

How best t' accost us in all quarters;<br/>

T' our question — and — command new Garters<br/>

And solidly discourse upon                                   1015<br/>

All sorts of dresses, Pro and Con.<br/>

For there's no mystery nor trade,<br/>

But in the art of love is made:<br/>

And when you have more debts to pay<br/>

Than Michaelmas and Lady-Day,                                1020<br/>

And no way possible to do't,<br/>

But love and oaths, and restless suit,<br/>

To us y' apply to pay the scores<br/>

Of all your cully'd, past amours;<br/>

Act o'er your flames and darts again,                        1025<br/>

And charge us with your wounds and pain;<br/>

Which others influences long since<br/>

Have charm'd your noses with and shins;<br/>

For which the surgeon is unpaid,<br/>

And like to be, without our aid.                             1030<br/>

Lord! what an am'rous thing is want!<br/>

How debts and mortgages inchant!<br/>

What graces must that lady have<br/>

That can from executions save!<br/>

What charms that can reverse extent,                         1035<br/>

And null decree and exigent!<br/>

What magical attracts and graces,<br/>

That can redeem from Scire facias!<br/>

From bonds and statutes can discharge,<br/>

And from contempts of courts enlarge!                        1040<br/>

These are the highest excellencies<br/>

Of all your true or false pretences:<br/>

And you would damn yourselves, and swear<br/>

As much t' an hostess dowager,<br/>

Grown fat and pursy by retail                                1045<br/>

Of pots of beer and bottled ale;<br/>

And find her fitter for your turn;<br/>

For fat is wondrous apt to burn;<br/>

Who at your flames would soon take fire,<br/>

Relent, and melt to your desire,                             1050<br/>

And like a candle in the socket,<br/>

Dissolve her graces int' your pocket.<br/>
</p>

<p>By this time 'twas grown dark and late,<br/>

When they heard a knocking at the gate,<br/>

Laid on in haste with such a powder,                         1055<br/>

The blows grew louder still and louder;<br/>

Which HUDIBRAS, as if th' had been<br/>

Bestow'd as freely on his skin,<br/>

Expounding, by his inward light,<br/>

Or rather more prophetick fright,                            1060<br/>

To be the Wizard, come to search,<br/>

And take him napping in the lurch<br/>

Turn'd pale as ashes or a clout;<br/>

But why or wherefore is a doubt<br/>

For men will tremble, and turn paler,                        1065<br/>

With too much or too little valour.<br/>

His heart laid on, as if it try'd<br/>

To force a passage through his side,<br/>

Impatient (as he vow'd) to wait 'em,<br/>

But in a fury to fly at 'em;                                 1070<br/>

And therefore beat, and laid about,<br/>

To find a cranny to creep out.<br/>

But she, who saw in what a taking<br/>

The Knight was by his furious quaking,<br/>

Undaunted cry'd, Courage, Sir Knight;                        1075<br/>

Know, I'm resolv'd to break no rite<br/>

Of hospitality t' a stranger;<br/>

But, to secure you out of danger,<br/>

Will here myself stand sentinel,<br/>

To guard this pass 'gainst SIDROPHEL.                        1080<br/>

Women, you know, do seldom fail<br/>

To make the stoutest men turn tail;<br/>

And bravely scorn to turn their backs<br/>

Upon the desp'ratest attacks.<br/>

At this the Knight grew resolute                             1085<br/>

As IRONSIDE and HARDIKNUTE<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-155" id="noteref-155" epub:type="noteref">155</a><br/>

His fortitude began to rally,<br/>

And out he cry'd aloud to sally.<br/>

But she besought him to convey<br/>

His courage rather out o' th' way,                           1090<br/>

And lodge in ambush on the floor,<br/>

Or fortify'd behind a door;<br/>

That if the enemy shou'd enter,<br/>

He might relieve her in th' adventure.<br/>
</p>

<p>Mean while they knock'd against the door                     1095<br/>

As fierce as at the gate before,<br/>

Which made the Renegado Knight<br/>

Relapse again t' his former fright.<br/>

He thought it desperate to stay<br/>

Till th' enemy had forc'd his way,                           1100<br/>

But rather post himself, to serve<br/>

The lady, for a fresh reserve<br/>

His duty was not to dispute,<br/>

But what sh' had order'd execute;<br/>

Which he resolv'd in haste t' obey,                          1105<br/>

And therefore stoutly march'd away;<br/>

And all h' encounter'd fell upon,<br/>

Though in the dark, and all alone;<br/>

Till fear, that braver feats performs<br/>

Than ever courage dar'd in arms,                             1110<br/>

Had drawn him up before a pass<br/>

To stand upon his guard, and face:<br/>

This he courageously invaded,<br/>

And having enter'd, barricado'd,<br/>

Insconc'd himself as formidable                              1115<br/>

As could be underneath a table,<br/>

Where he lay down in ambush close,<br/>

T' expect th' arrival of his foes.<br/>

Few minutes he had lain perdue,<br/>

To guard his desp'rate avenue,                               1120<br/>

Before he heard a dreadful shout,<br/>

As loud as putting to the rout,<br/>

With which impatiently alarm'd,<br/>

He fancy'd th' enemy had storm'd,<br/>

And, after ent'ring, SIDROPHEL                               1125<br/>

Was fall'n upon the guards pell-mell<br/>

He therefore sent out all his senses,<br/>

To bring him in intelligences,<br/>

Which vulgars, out of ignorance,<br/>

Mistake for falling in a trance;                             1130<br/>

But those that trade in geomancy,<br/>

Affirm to be the strength of fancy;<br/>

In which the Lapland Magi deal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-156" id="noteref-156" epub:type="noteref">156</a><br/>

And things incredible reveal.<br/>

Mean while the foe beat up his quarters,                     1135<br/>

And storm'd the out-works of his fortress:<br/>

And as another, of the same<br/>

Degree and party, in arms and fame,<br/>

That in the same cause had engag'd,<br/>

At war with equal conduct wag'd,                             1140<br/>

By vent'ring only but to thrust<br/>

His head a span beyond his post,<br/>

B' a gen'ral of the cavaliers<br/>

Was dragg'd thro' a window by th' ears;<br/>

So he was serv'd in his redoubt,                             1145<br/>

And by the other end pull'd out.<br/>
</p>

<p>Soon as they had him at their mercy,<br/>

They put him to the cudgel fiercely,<br/>

As if they'd scorn'd to trade or barter,<br/>

By giving or by taking quarter:                              1150<br/>

They stoutly on his quarters laid,<br/>

Until his scouts came in t' his aid.<br/>

For when a man is past his sense,<br/>

There's no way to reduce him thence,<br/>

But twinging him by th' ears or nose,                        1155<br/>

Or laying on of heavy blows;<br/>

And if that will not do the deed,<br/>

To burning with hot irons proceed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-157" id="noteref-157" epub:type="noteref">157</a><br/>

No sooner was he come t' himself,<br/>

But on his neck a sturdy elf                                 1160<br/>

Clapp'd, in a trice, his cloven hoof,<br/>

And thus attack'd him with reproof;<br/>

Mortal, thou art betray'd to us<br/>

B' our friend, thy Evil Genius,<br/>

Who, for thy horrid perjuries,                               1165<br/>

Thy breach of faith, and turning lies,<br/>

The Brethren's privilege (against<br/>

The wicked) on themselves, the Saints,<br/>

Has here thy wretched carcase sent<br/>

For just revenge and punishment;                             1170<br/>

Which thou hast now no way to lessen,<br/>

But by an open, free confession;<br/>

For if we catch thee failing once,<br/>

'Twill fall the heavier on thy bones.<br/>
</p>

<p>What made thee venture to betray,                            1175<br/>

And filch the lady's heart away?<br/>

To Spirit her to matrimony? —<br/>

That which contracts all matches — money.<br/>

It was th' inchantment oft her riches<br/>

That made m' apply t' your croney witches,                   1180<br/>

That, in return, wou'd pay th' expence,<br/>

The wear and tear of conscience;<br/>

Which I cou'd have patch'd up, and turn'd,<br/>

For the hundredth part of what I earn'd.<br/>
</p>

<p>Didst thou not love her then? Speak true.                    1185<br/>

No more (quoth he) than I love you. —<br/>

How would'st th' have us'd her, and her money? —<br/>

First turn'd her up to alimony;<br/>

And laid her dowry out in law,<br/>

To null her jointure with a flaw,                            1190<br/>

Which I before-hand had agreed<br/>

T' have put, on purpose in the deed;<br/>

And bar her widow's making over<br/>

T' a friend in trust, or private lover.<br/>
</p>

<p>What made thee pick and chuse her out,                       1195<br/>

T' employ their sorceries about? —<br/>

That which makes gamesters play with those<br/>

Who have least wit, and most to lose.<br/>
</p>

<p>But didst thou scourge thy vessel thus,<br/>

As thou hast damn'd thyself to us?                           1200<br/>
</p>

<p>I see you take me for an ass:<br/>

'Tis true, I thought the trick wou'd pass<br/>

Upon a woman well enough,<br/>

As 't has been often found by proof,<br/>

Whose humours are not to be won,                             1205<br/>

But when they are impos'd upon.<br/>

For love approves of all they do<br/>

That stand for candidates, and woo.<br/>
</p>

<p>Why didst thou forge those shameful lies<br/>

Of bears and witches in disguise?                            1210<br/>
</p>

<p>That is no more than authors give<br/>

The rabble credit to believe:<br/>

A trick of following their leaders,<br/>

To entertain their gentle readers;<br/>

And we have now no other way                                 1215<br/>

Of passing all we do or say<br/>

Which, when 'tis natural and true,<br/>

Will be believ'd b' a very few,<br/>

Beside the danger of offence,<br/>

The fatal enemy of sense.                                    1220<br/>
</p>

<p>Why did thou chuse that cursed sin,<br/>

Hypocrisy, to set up in?<br/>
</p>

<p>Because it is in the thriving'st calling,<br/>

The only Saints-bell that rings all in;<br/>

In which all churches are concern'd,                         1225<br/>

And is the easiest to be learn'd:<br/>

For no degrees, unless th' employ't,<br/>

Can ever gain much, or enjoy't:<br/>

A gift that is not only able<br/>

To domineer among the rabble,                                1230<br/>

But by the laws impower'd to rout,<br/>

And awe the greatest that stand out;<br/>

Which few hold forth against, for fear<br/>

Their hands should slip, and come too near;<br/>

For no sin else among the Saints                             1235<br/>

Is taught so tenderly against.<br/>
</p>

<p>What made thee break thy plighted vows? —<br/>

That which makes others break a house,<br/>

And hang, and scorn ye all, before<br/>

Endure the plague of being poor.                             1240<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, I see you have more tricks<br/>

Than all your doating politicks,<br/>

That are grown old, and out of fashion,<br/>

Compar'd with your New Reformation;<br/>

That we must come to school to you,                          1245<br/>

To learn your more refin'd, and new.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, If you will give me leave<br/>

To tell you what I now perceive,<br/>

You'll find yourself an arrant chouse,<br/>

If y' were but at a Meeting-House. —                        1250<br/>

'Tis true, quoth he, we ne'er come there,<br/>

Because, w' have let 'em out by th' year.<br/>
</p>

<p>Truly, quoth he, you can't imagine<br/>

What wond'rous things they will engage in<br/>

That as your fellow-fiends in Hell                           1255<br/>

Were angels all before they fell,<br/>

So are you like to be agen,<br/>

Compar'd with th' angels of us men.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, I am resolv'd to be<br/>

Thy scholar in this mystery;                                 1260<br/>

And therefore first desire to know<br/>

Some principles on which you go.<br/>
</p>

<p>What makes a knave a child of God,<br/>

And one of us? — A livelihood.<br/>

What renders beating out of brains,                          1265<br/>

And murder, godliness? — Great gains.<br/>
</p>

<p>What's tender conscience? — 'Tis a botch,<br/>

That will not bear the gentlest touch;<br/>

But breaking out, dispatches more<br/>

Than th' epidemical'st plague-sore.                          1270<br/>
</p>

<p>What makes y' encroach upon our trade,<br/>

And damn all others?  — To be paid.<br/>
</p>

<p>What's orthodox, and true, believing<br/>

Against a conscience? — A good living.<br/>
</p>

<p>What makes rebelling against Kings                           1275<br/>

A Good Old Cause? — Administrings.<br/>
</p>

<p>What makes all doctrines plain and clear? —<br/>

About two hundred pounds a year.<br/>
</p>

<p>And that which was prov'd true before,<br/>

Prove false again? — Two hundred more.                      1280<br/>
</p>

<p>What makes the breaking of all oaths<br/>

A holy duty? — Food and cloaths.<br/>
</p>

<p>What laws and freedom, persecution? —<br/>

B'ing out of pow'r, and contribution.<br/>
</p>

<p>What makes a church a den of thieves? —                     1285<br/>

A dean and chapter, and white sleeves.<br/>
</p>

<p>Ad what would serve, if those were gone,<br/>

To make it orthodox? — Our own.<br/>
</p>

<p>What makes morality a crime,<br/>

The most notorious of the time;                              1290<br/>

Morality, which both the Saints,<br/>

And wicked too, cry out against? —<br/>

Cause grace and virtue are within<br/>

Prohibited degrees of kin<br/>

And therefore no true Saint allows,                          1295<br/>

They shall be suffer'd to espouse;<br/>

For Saints can need no conscience,<br/>

That with morality dispense;<br/>

As virtue's impious, when 'tis rooted<br/>

In nature only, and not imputed                              1300<br/>

But why the wicked should do so,<br/>

We neither know, or care to do.<br/>
</p>

<p>What's liberty of conscience,<br/>

I' th' natural and genuine sense?<br/>

'Tis to restore, with more security,                         1305<br/>

Rebellion to its ancient purity;<br/>

And christian liberty reduce<br/>

To th' elder practice of the Jews.<br/>

For a large conscience is all one,<br/>

And signifies the same with none.                            1310<br/>
</p>

<p>It is enough (quoth he) for once,<br/>

And has repriev'd thy forfeit bones:<br/>

NICK MACHIAVEL had ne'er a trick,<br/>

(Though he gave his name to our Old Nick,)<br/>

But was below the least of these,                            1315<br/>

That pass i' th' world for holiness.<br/>
</p>

<p>This said, the furies and the light<br/>

In th' instant vanish'd out of sight,<br/>

And left him in the dark alone,<br/>

With stinks of brimstone and his own.                        1320<br/>
</p>

<p>The Queen of Night,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-158" id="noteref-158" epub:type="noteref">158</a> whose large command<br/>

Rules all the sea, and half the land,<br/>

And over moist and crazy brains,<br/>

In high spring-tides, at midnight reigns,<br/>

Was now declining to the west,                               1325<br/>

To go to bed, and take her rest;<br/>

When HUDIBRAS, whose stubborn blows<br/>

Deny'd his bones that soft repose,<br/>

Lay still expecting worse and more,<br/>

Stretch'd out at length upon the floor;                      1330<br/>

And though he shut his eyes as fast<br/>

As if h' had been to sleep his last,<br/>

Saw all the shapes that fear or wizards<br/>

Do make the Devil wear for vizards,<br/>

And pricking up his ears, to hark                            1335<br/>

If he cou'd hear too in the dark,<br/>

Was first invaded with a groan<br/>

And after in a feeble tone,<br/>

These trembling words: Unhappy wretch!<br/>

What hast thou gotten by this fetch;                         1340<br/>

For all thy tricks, in this new trade,<br/>

Thy holy brotherhood o' th' blade?<br/>

By sauntring still on some adventure,<br/>

And growing to thy horse a Centaure?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-159" id="noteref-159" epub:type="noteref">159</a><br/>

To stuff thy skin with swelling knobs                        1345<br/>

Of cruel and hard-wooded drubs?<br/>

For still th' hast had the worst on't yet,<br/>

As well in conquest as defeat.<br/>

Night is the sabbath of mankind,<br/>

To rest the body and the mind,                               1350<br/>

Which now thou art deny'd to keep,<br/>

And cure thy labour'd corpse with sleep.<br/>

The Knight, who heard the words, explain'd,<br/>

As meant to him, this reprimand,<br/>

Because the character did hit                                1355<br/>

Point-blank upon his case so fit;<br/>

Believ'd it was some drolling spright,<br/>

That staid upon the guard that night,<br/>

And one of those h' had seen, and felt<br/>

The drubs he had so freely dealt;                            1360<br/>

When, after a short pause and groan,<br/>

The doleful Spirit thus went on:<br/>
</p>

<p>This 'tis t' engage with dogs and bears<br/>

Pell-mell together by the ears,<br/>

And, after painful bangs and knocks,                         1365<br/>

To lie in limbo in the stocks,<br/>

And from the pinnacle of glory<br/>

Fall headlong into purgatory.<br/>
</p>

<p>(Thought he, this devil's full of malice,<br/>

That in my late disasters rallies:)                          1370<br/>

Condemn'd to whipping, but declin'd it,<br/>

By being more heroic-minded:<br/>

And at a riding handled worse,<br/>

With treats more slovenly and coarse:<br/>

Engag'd with fiends in stubborn wars,                        1375<br/>

And hot disputes with conjurers;<br/>

And when th' hadst bravely won the day,<br/>

Wast fain to steal thyself away.<br/>
</p>

<p>(I see, thought he, this shameless elf<br/>

Wou'd fain steal me too from myself,                         1380<br/>

That impudently dares to own<br/>

What I have suffer'd for and done,)<br/>

And now but vent'ring to betray,<br/>

Hast met with vengeance the same way.<br/>
</p>

<p>Thought he, how does the Devil know                          1385<br/>

What 'twas that I design'd to do?<br/>

His office of intelligence,<br/>

His oracles, are ceas'd long since;<br/>

And he knows nothing of the Saints,<br/>

But what some treacherous spy acquaints.                     1390<br/>

This is some pettifogging fiend,<br/>

Some under door-keeper's friend's friend,<br/>

That undertakes to understand,<br/>

And juggles at the second-hand;<br/>

And now would pass for Spirit Po,                            1395<br/>

And all mens' dark concerns foreknow.<br/>

I think I need not fear him for't;<br/>

These rallying devils do no hurt.<br/>

With that he rouz'd his drooping heart,<br/>

And hastily cry'd out, What art?                             1400<br/>

A wretch (quoth he) whom want of grace<br/>

Has brought to this unhappy place.<br/>
</p>

<p>I do believe thee, quoth the Knight;<br/>

Thus far I'm sure th' art in the right;<br/>

And know what 'tis that troubles thee,                       1405<br/>

Better than thou hast guess'd of me.<br/>

Thou art some paultry, black-guard spright,<br/>

Condemn'd to drudg'ry in the night<br/>

Thou hast no work to do in th' house<br/>

Nor half-penny to drop in shoes;                             1410<br/>

Without the raising of which sum,<br/>

You dare not be so troublesome,<br/>

To pinch the slatterns black and blue,<br/>

For leaving you their work to do.<br/>

This is your bus'ness good Pug-Robin;                        1415<br/>

And your diversion dull dry-bobbing,<br/>

T' entice fanaticks in the dirt,<br/>

And wash them clean in ditches for't;<br/>

Of which conceit you are so proud,<br/>

At ev'ry jest you laugh aloud,                               1420<br/>

As now you wou'd have done by me,<br/>

But that I barr'd your raillery.<br/>
</p>

<p>Sir (quoth the voice) y'are no such Sophi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-160" id="noteref-160" epub:type="noteref">160</a><br/>

As you would have the world judge of ye.<br/>

If you design to weigh our talents                           1425<br/>

I' the standard of your own false balance,<br/>

Or think it possible to know<br/>

Us ghosts as well as we do you;<br/>

We, who have been the everlasting<br/>

Companions of your drubs and basting,                        1430<br/>

And never left you in contest,<br/>

With male or female, man or beast,<br/>

But prov'd as true t' ye, and entire,<br/>

In all adventures, as your Squire.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, That may be said as true                           1435<br/>

By the idlest pug of all your crew:<br/>

For none cou'd have betray'd us worse<br/>

Than those allies of ours and yours.<br/>

But I have sent him for a token<br/>

To your Low-Country HOGEN-MOGEN,                             1440<br/>

To whose infernal shores I hope<br/>

He'll swing like skippers in a rope.<br/>

And, if y' have been more just to me<br/>

(As I am apt to think) than he,<br/>

I am afraid it is as true,                                   1445<br/>

What th' ill-affected say of you:<br/>

Y' have spous'd the Covenant and Cause,<br/>

By holding up your cloven paws.<br/>
</p>

<p>Sir, quoth the voice, 'tis true, I grant,<br/>

We made and took the Covenant;                               1450<br/>

But that no more concerns the Cause<br/>

Than other perj'ries do the laws,<br/>

Which when they're prov'd in open court,<br/>

Wear wooden peccadillo's for't:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-161" id="noteref-161" epub:type="noteref">161</a><br/>

And that's the reason Cov'nanters                            1455<br/>

Hold up their hands like rogues at bars.<br/>
</p>

<p>I see, quoth HUDIBRAS, from whence<br/>

These scandals of the Saints commence,<br/>

That are but natural effects<br/>

Of Satan's malice, and his sects,                            1460<br/>

Those Spider-Saints, that hang by threads,<br/>

Spun out o' th' intrails of their heads.<br/>
</p>

<p>Sir, quoth the voice, that may as true<br/>

And properly be said of you,<br/>

Whose talents may compare with either,                       1465<br/>

Or both the other put together.<br/>

For all the Independents do,<br/>

Is only what you forc'd 'em to;<br/>

You, who are not content alone<br/>

With tricks to put the Devil down,                           1470<br/>

But must have armies rais'd to back<br/>

The gospel-work you undertake;<br/>

As if artillery, and edge-tools,<br/>

Were the only engines to save souls;<br/>

While he, poor devil, has no pow'r                           1475<br/>

By force to run down and devour;<br/>

Has ne'er a Classis; cannot sentence<br/>

To stools or poundage of repentance;<br/>

Is ty'd up only to design,<br/>

T' entice, and tempt, and undermine,                         1480<br/>

In which you all his arts out-do,<br/>

And prove yourselves his betters too.<br/>

Hence 'tis possessions do less evil<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-162" id="noteref-162" epub:type="noteref">162</a><br/>

Than mere temptations of the Devil,<br/>

Which, all the horrid'st actions done,                       1485<br/>

Are charg'd in courts of law upon;<br/>

Because unless they help the elf,<br/>

He can do little of himself;<br/>

And therefore where he's best possess'd<br/>

Acts most against his interest;                              1490<br/>

Surprizes none, but those wh' have priests<br/>

To turn him out, and exorcists,<br/>

Supply'd with spiritual provision,<br/>

And magazines of ammunition<br/>

With crosses, relicks, crucifixes,                           1495<br/>

Beads, pictures, rosaries, and pixes;<br/>

The tools of working our salvation<br/>

By mere mechanick operation;<br/>

With holy water, like a sluice,<br/>

To overflow all avenues.                                     1500<br/>

But those wh' are utterly unarm'd<br/>

T' oppose his entrance, if he storm'd,<br/>

He never offers to surprize,<br/>

Although his falsest enemies;<br/>

But is content to be their drudge,                           1505<br/>

And on their errands glad to trudge<br/>

For where are all your forfeitures<br/>

Entrusted in safe hands but ours?<br/>

Who are but jailors of the holes,                            1510<br/>

And dungeons where you clap up souls;<br/>

Like under-keepers, turn the keys,<br/>

T' your mittimus anathemas;<br/>

And never boggle to restore<br/>

The members you deliver o're<br/>

Upon demand, with fairer justice                             1515<br/>

Than all your covenanting Trustees;<br/>

Unless to punish them the worse,<br/>

You put them in the secular pow'rs,<br/>

And pass their souls, as some demise<br/>

The same estate in mortgage twice;                           1520<br/>

When to a legal Utlegation<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-163" id="noteref-163" epub:type="noteref">163</a><br/>

You turn your excommunication,<br/>

And for a groat unpaid, that's due,<br/>

Distrain on soul and body too.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-164" id="noteref-164" epub:type="noteref">164</a><br/>
</p>

<p>Thought he, 'tis no mean part of civil                       1525<br/>

State prudence to cajole the Devil<br/>

And not to handle him too rough,<br/>

When h' has us in his cloven hoof.<br/>
</p>

<p>T' is true, quoth he, that intercourse<br/>

Has pass'd between your friends and ours;                    1530<br/>

That as you trust us, in our way,<br/>

To raise your members, and to lay,<br/>

We send you others of our own,<br/>

Denounc'd to hang themselves or drown;<br/>

Or, frighted with our oratory,                               1435<br/>

To leap down headlong many a story<br/>

Have us'd all means to propagate<br/>

Your mighty interests of state;<br/>

Laid out our spiritual gifts to further<br/>

Your great designs of rage and murther.                      1540<br/>

For if the Saints are nam'd from blood,<br/>

We only have made that title good;<br/>

And if it were but in our power,<br/>

We should not scruple to do more,<br/>

And not be half a soul behind                                1545<br/>

Of all dissenters of mankind.<br/>
</p>

<p>Right, quoth the voice, and as I scorn<br/>

To be ungrateful, in return<br/>

Of all those kind good offices,<br/>

I'll free you out of this distress,                          1550<br/>

And set you down in safety, where<br/>

It is no time to tell you here.<br/>

The cock crows, and the morn grows on,<br/>

When 'tis decreed I must be gone;<br/>

And if I leave you here till day,                            1555<br/>

You'll find it hard to get away.<br/>
</p>

<p>With that the Spirit grop'd about,<br/>

To find th' inchanted hero out,<br/>

And try'd with haste to lift him up;<br/>

But found his forlorn hope, his crup,                        1560<br/>

Unserviceable with kicks and blows,<br/>

Receiv'd from harden'd-hearted foes.<br/>

He thought to drag him by the heels,<br/>

Like Gresham carts, with legs for wheels;<br/>

But fear, that soonest cures those sores                     1565<br/>

In danger of relapse to worse,<br/>

Came in t' assist him with it's aid<br/>

And up his sinking vessel weigh'd.<br/>

No sooner was he fit to trudge,<br/>

But both made ready to dislodge.                             1570<br/>

The Spirit hors'd him like a sack<br/>

Upon the vehicle his back;<br/>

And bore him headlong into th' hall,<br/>

With some few rubs against the wall<br/>

Where finding out the postern lock'd,                        1575<br/>

And th' avenues as strongly block'd,<br/>

H' attack'd the window, storm'd the glass,<br/>

And in a moment gain'd the pass;<br/>

Thro' which he dragg'd the worsted souldier's<br/>

Fore-quarters out by the head and shoulders;                 1580<br/>

And cautiously began to scout,<br/>

To find their fellow-cattle out.<br/>

Nor was it half a minute's quest,<br/>

E're he retriev'd the champion's beast,<br/>

Ty'd to a pale, instead of rack;                             1585<br/>

But ne'er a saddle on his back,<br/>

Nor pistols at the saddle-bow,<br/>

Convey'd away the Lord knows how,<br/>

He thought it was no time to stay,<br/>

And let the night too steal away;                            1590<br/>

But in a trice advanc'd the Knight<br/>

Upon the bare ridge, bolt upright:<br/>

And groping out for RALPHO's jade,<br/>

He found the saddle too was stray'd,<br/>

And in the place a lump of soap,                             1595<br/>

On which he speedily leap'd up;<br/>

And turning to the gate the rein,<br/>

He kick'd and cudgell'd on amain.<br/>

While HUDIBRAS, with equal haste,<br/>

On both sides laid about as fast,                            1600<br/>

And spurr'd as jockies use to break,<br/>

Or padders to secure, a neck<br/>

Where let us leave 'em for a time,<br/>

And to their Churches turn our rhyme;<br/>

To hold forth their declining state,                         1605<br/>

Which now come near an even rate.<br/>
