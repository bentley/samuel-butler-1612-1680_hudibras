<p id="id00501">————————————————————————-<br/>

The Saints engage in fierce Contests<br/>

About their Carnal interests;<br/>

To share their sacrilegious Preys,<br/>

According to their Rates of Grace;<br/>

Their various Frenzies to reform,<br/>

When Cromwel left them in a Storm<br/>

Till, in th' Effigy of Rumps, the Rabble<br/>

Burns all their Grandees of the Cabal.<br/>

————————————————————————-<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00502" style="margin-top: 2em">THE learned write, an &lt;g&gt; insect breeze<br/>

Is but a mungrel prince of bees,<br/>

That falls before a storm on cows,<br/>

And stings the founders of his house;<br/>

From whose corrupted flesh that breed                           5<br/>

Of vermin did at first proceed.<br/>

So e're the storm of war broke out,<br/>

Religion spawn'd a various rout<br/>

Of petulant Capricious sects,<br/>

The maggots of corrupted texts,                                10<br/>

That first run all religion down,<br/>

And after ev'ry swarm its own.<br/>

For as the Persian &lt;h&gt; Magi once<br/>

Upon their mothers got their sons,<br/>

That were incapable t' enjoy                                   15<br/>

That empire any other way;<br/>

So PRESBYTER begot the other<br/>

Upon the good old Cause, his mother,<br/>

Then bore then like the Devil's dam,<br/>

Whose son and husband are the same.                            20<br/>

And yet no nat'ral tie of blood<br/>

Nor int'rest for the common good<br/>

Cou'd, when their profits interfer'd,<br/>

Get quarter for each other's beard.<br/>

For when they thriv'd, they never fadg'd,                      25<br/>

But only by the ears engag'd:<br/>

Like dogs that snarl about a bone,<br/>

And play together when they've none,<br/>

As by their truest characters,<br/>

Their constant actions, plainly appears.                       30<br/>

Rebellion now began, for lack<br/>

Of zeal and plunders to grow slack;<br/>

The Cause and covenant to lessen,<br/>

And Providence to b' out of season:<br/>

For now there was no more to purchase                          35<br/>

O' th' King's Revenue, and the Churches,<br/>

But all divided, shar'd, and gone,<br/>

That us'd to urge the Brethren on;<br/>

Which forc'd the stubborn'st for the Cause,<br/>

To cross the cudgels to the laws,                              40<br/>

That what by breaking them th' had gain'd.<br/>

By their support might be maintain'd;<br/>

Like thieves, that in a hemp-plot lie<br/>

Secur'd against the hue-and-cry;<br/>

For PRESBYTER and INDEPENDANT                                  45<br/>

Were now turn'd plaintiff and defendant;<br/>

Laid out their apostolic functions<br/>

On carnal orders and injunctions;<br/>

And all their precious Gifts and Graces<br/>

On outlawries and scire facias;                                50<br/>

At &lt;i&gt; Michael's term had many a trial,<br/>

Worse than the Dragon and St. Michael,<br/>

Where thousands fell, in shape of fees,<br/>

Into the bottomless abyss.<br/>

For when like brethren, and like friends,                      55<br/>

They came to share their dividends,<br/>

And ev'ry partner to possess<br/>

His Church and State Joint-Purchases,<br/>

In which the ablest Saint, and best,<br/>

Was nam'd in trust by all the rest,                            60<br/>

To pay their money; and, instead<br/>

Of ev'ry Brother, pass the deed;<br/>

He strait converted all his gifts<br/>

To pious frauds and holy shifts;<br/>

And settled all the other shares                               65<br/>

Upon his outward man and's heirs;<br/>

Held all they claim'd as forfeit lands,<br/>

Deliver'd up into his hands,<br/>

And pass'd upon his conscience,<br/>

By Pre-intail of Providence;                                   70<br/>

Impeach'd the rest for reprobates,<br/>

That had no titles to estates,<br/>

But by their spiritual attaints<br/>

Degraded from the right of Saints.<br/>

This b'ing reveal'd, they now begun                            75<br/>

With law and conscience to fall on,<br/>

And laid about as hot and brain-sick<br/>

As th' Utter Barrister of &lt;k&gt; SWANSWICK;<br/>

Engag'd with moneybags as bold<br/>

As men with sand bags did of old;                              80<br/>

That brought the lawyers in more fees<br/>

Than all unsanctify'd Trustees;<br/>

Till he who had no more to show<br/>

I' th' case receiv'd the overthrow;<br/>

Or both sides having had the worst,                            85<br/>

They parted as they met at first.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00503">Poor PRESBYTER was now reduc'd,<br/>

Secluded, and cashier'd, and chous'd<br/>

Turn'd out, and excommunicate<br/>

From all affairs of Church and State;                          90<br/>

Reform'd t' a reformado Saint,<br/>

And glad to turn itinerant,<br/>

To stroll and teach from town to town,<br/>

And those he had taught up, teach down.<br/>

And make those uses serve agen                                 95<br/>

Against the new-enlighten'd men,<br/>

As fit as when at first they were<br/>

Reveal'd against the CAVALIER;<br/>

Damn ANABAPTIST and FANATIC,<br/>

As pat as Popish and Prelatic;                                100<br/>

And with as little variation,<br/>

To serve for any Sect i' th' nation.<br/>

The Good Old Cause, which some believe<br/>

To be the Dev'l that tempted EVE<br/>

With Knowledge, and does still invite                         105<br/>

The world to mischief with new Light,<br/>

Had store of money in her purse<br/>

When he took her for bett'r or worse;<br/>

But now was grown deform'd and poor,<br/>

And fit to be turn'd out of door.                             110<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00504">The INDEPENDENTS (whose first station<br/>

Was in the rear of reformation,<br/>

A mungrel kind of church-dragoons,<br/>

That serv'd for horse and foot at once;<br/>

And in the saddle of one steed                                115<br/>

The Saracen and Christian rid;<br/>

Were free of ev'ry spiritual order,<br/>

To preach, and fight, and pray, and murder)<br/>

No sooner got the start to lurch<br/>

Both disciplines, of War and Church                           120<br/>

And Providence enough to run<br/>

The chief commanders of 'em down,<br/>

But carry'd on the war against<br/>

The common enemy o' th' Saints,<br/>

And in a while prevail'd so far,                              125<br/>

To win of them the game of war,<br/>

And be at liberty once more<br/>

T' attack themselves, as th' had before.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00505">For now there was no foe in arms,<br/>

T' unite their factions with alarms,                          130<br/>

But all reduc'd and overcome,<br/>

Except their worst, themselves at home,<br/>

Wh' had compass'd all they pray'd, and swore,<br/>

And fought, and preach'd, and plunder'd for;<br/>

Subdu'd the Nation, Church, and State,                        135<br/>

And all things, but their laws and hate:<br/>

But when they came to treat and transact,<br/>

And share the spoil of all th' had ransackt,<br/>

To botch up what th' had torn and rent,<br/>

Religion and the Government,                                  140<br/>

They met no sooner, but prepar'd<br/>

To pull down all the war had spar'd<br/>

Agreed in nothing, but t' abolish,<br/>

Subvert, extirpate, and demolish.<br/>

For knaves and fools b'ing near of kin                        145<br/>

As &lt;l&gt; Dutch Boors are t' a Sooterkin,<br/>

Both parties join'd to do their best<br/>

To damn the publick interest,<br/>

And herded only in consults,<br/>

To put by one another's bolts;                                150<br/>

T' out-cant the &lt;m&gt; Babylonian labourers,<br/>

At all their dialects of jabberers,<br/>

And tug at both ends of the saw,<br/>

To tear down Government and Law.<br/>

For as two cheats, that play one game,                        155<br/>

Are both defeated of their aim;<br/>

So those who play a game of state,<br/>

And only cavil in debate,<br/>

Although there's nothing lost or won,<br/>

The publick bus'ness is undone;                               160<br/>

Which still the longer 'tis in doing,<br/>

Becomes the surer way to ruin.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00506">This, when the ROYALISTS perceiv'd,<br/>

(Who to their faith as firmly cleav'd,<br/>

And own'd the right they had paid down                        165<br/>

So dearly for, the Church and Crown,)<br/>

Th' united constanter, and sided<br/>

The more, the more their foes divided.<br/>

For though out-number'd, overthrown<br/>

And by the fate of war run down)                              170<br/>

Their duty never was defeated,<br/>

Nor from their oaths and faith retreated;<br/>

For loyalty is still the same,<br/>

Whether it win or lose the game;<br/>

True as the dial to the sun,                                  175<br/>

Although it be not shin'd upon.<br/>

But when these brethren in evil,<br/>

Their adversaries, and the Devil,<br/>

Began once more to shew them play,<br/>

And hopes, at least, to have a day,                           180<br/>

They rally'd in parades of woods,<br/>

And unfrequented solitudes;<br/>

Conven'd at midnight in out-houses,<br/>

T' appoint new-rising rendezvouzes,<br/>

And with a pertinacy unmatch'd,                               185<br/>

For new recruits of danger watch'd.<br/>

No sooner was one blow diverted,<br/>

But up another party started;<br/>

And, as if nature too, in haste<br/>

To furnish out supplies as fast,                              190<br/>

Before her time, had turn'd destruction<br/>

T' a new and numerous production,<br/>

No sooner those were overcome,<br/>

But up rose others in their room,<br/>

That, like the Christian faith, increast                      195<br/>

The more, the more they were supprest<br/>

Whom neither chains, nor transportation,<br/>

Proscription, sale, or confiscation,<br/>

Nor all the desperate events<br/>

Of former try'd experiments                                   200<br/>

Nor wounds cou'd terrify, nor mangling,<br/>

To leave off loyalty and dangling;<br/>

Nor death (with all his bones) affright<br/>

From vent'ring to maintain the right,<br/>

From staking life and fortune down                            205<br/>

'Gainst all together, for the Crown;<br/>

But kept the title of their cause<br/>

From forfeiture, like claims in laws<br/>

And prov'd no prosp'rous usurpation<br/>

Can ever settle in the nation;                                210<br/>

Until, in spight of force and treason,<br/>

They put their loyalty in possession;<br/>

And by their constancy and faith,<br/>

Destroy 'd the mighty men of Gath.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00507">Toss'd in a furious hurricane,                                215<br/>

Did OLIVER give up his reign;<br/>

And was believ'd, as well by Saints,<br/>

As mortal men and miscreants,<br/>

To founder in the Stygian Ferry;<br/>

Until he was retriev'd by STERRY,                             220<br/>

Who, in a faise erroneous dream,<br/>

Mistook the New Jerusalem<br/>

Prophanely for the apocryphal<br/>

&lt;o&gt; False Heaven at the end o' th' Hall;<br/>

Whither it was decreed by Fate                                225<br/>

His precious reliques to translate.<br/>

So ROMULUS &lt;p&gt; was seen before<br/>

B' as orthodox a Senator;<br/>

From whose divine illumination<br/>

He stole the Pagan revelation.                                230<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00508">Next him his &lt;q&gt; Son and Heir Apparent<br/>

Succeeded, though a lame vicegerent;<br/>

Who first laid by the Parliament,<br/>

The only crutch on which he leant;<br/>

And then sunk underneath the State,                           235<br/>

That rode him above horseman's weight.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00509">And now the Saints began their reign,<br/>

For which th' had yearn'd so long in vain,<br/>

And felt such bowel-hankerings,<br/>

To see an empire all of Kings.                                240<br/>

Deliver'd from the Egyptian awe<br/>

Of Justice, Government, and Law,<br/>

And free t' erect what spiritual Cantons<br/>

Should be reveal'd, or Gospel Hans-Towns,<br/>

To edify upon the ruins                                       245<br/>

Of &lt;r&gt; JOHN of LEYDEN'S old Out-goings;<br/>

Who for a weather-cock hung up,<br/>

Upon the Mother Church's top;<br/>

Was made a type, by Providence,<br/>

Of all their revelations since;                               250<br/>

And now fulfill'd by his successors,<br/>

Who equally mistook their measures<br/>

For when they came to shape the model,<br/>

Not one could fit another's noddle;<br/>

But found their Light and Gifts more wide                     255<br/>

From fadging than th' unsanctify'd;<br/>

While ev'ry individual brother<br/>

Strove hand to fist against another;<br/>

And still the maddest, and most crackt,<br/>

Were found the busiest to transact                            260<br/>

For though most hands dispatch apace,<br/>

And make light work, (the proverb says,)<br/>

Yet many diff'rent intellects<br/>

Are found t' have contrary effects;<br/>

And many heads t' obstruct intrigues,                         265<br/>

As slowest insects have most legs.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00510">Some were for setting up a King;<br/>

But all the rest for no such thing,<br/>

Unless KING JESUS. Others tamper'd<br/>

For FLEETWOOD, DESBOROUGH, and LAMBERT;                       270<br/>

Some for the Rump; and some, more crafty,<br/>

For Agitators, and the safety;<br/>

Some for the Gospel, and massacres<br/>

Of Spiritual Affidavit-makers,<br/>

That swore to any human regence,                              275<br/>

Oaths of supremacy and allegiance;<br/>

Yea, though the ablest swearing Saint<br/>

That vouch'd the Bulls o' th' Covenant:<br/>

Others for pulling down th' high-places<br/>

Of Synods and Provincial Classes,                             280<br/>

That us'd to make such hostile inroads<br/>

Upon the Saints, like bloody NIMRODS<br/>

Some for fulfilling prophecies,<br/>

And th' expiration of th' excise<br/>

And some against th' Egyptian bondage                         285<br/>

Of holy-days, and paying poundage:<br/>

Some for the cutting down of groves,<br/>

And rectifying bakers' loaves:<br/>

And some for finding out expedients<br/>

Against the slav'ry of obedience.                             290<br/>

Some were for Gospel Ministers,<br/>

And some for Red-coat Seculars,<br/>

As men most fit t' hold forth the word,<br/>

And wield the one and th' other sword.<br/>

Some were for carrying on the work                            295<br/>

Against the Pope, and some the Turk;<br/>

Some for engaging to suppress,<br/>

The Camisado of surplices,<br/>

That gifts and dispensations hinder'd,<br/>

And turn'd to th' Outward Man the Inward;                     300<br/>

More proper for the cloudy night<br/>

Of Popery than Gospel Light.<br/>

Others were for abolishing<br/>

That tool of matrimony, a ring,<br/>

With which th' unsanctify'd bridegroom                        305<br/>

Is marry'd only to a thumb;<br/>

(As wise as ringing of a pig,<br/>

That us'd to break up ground, and dig;)<br/>

The bride to nothing but her will,<br/>

That nulls the after-marriage still                           310<br/>

Some were for th' utter extirpation<br/>

Of linsey-woolsey in the nation;<br/>

And some against all idolizing<br/>

The Cross in shops-books, or Baptizing<br/>

Others to make all things recant                              315<br/>

The Christian or Surname of Saint;<br/>

And force all churches, streets, and towns,<br/>

The holy title to renounce.<br/>

Some 'gainst a Third Estate of Souls,<br/>

And bringing down the price of coals:                         320<br/>

Some for abolishing black-pudding,<br/>

And eating nothing with the blood in;<br/>

To abrogate them roots and branches;<br/>

While others were for eating haunches<br/>

Of warriors, and now and then,                                325<br/>

The flesh of Kings and mighty men<br/>

And some for breaking of their bones<br/>

With rods of ir'n, by secret ones:<br/>

For thrashing mountains, and with spells<br/>

For hallowing carriers' packs and bells:                      330<br/>

Things that the legend never heard of,<br/>

But made the wicked sore afear'd of.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00511">The quacks of Government (who sate<br/>

At th' unregarded helm of State,<br/>

And understood this wild confusion                            335<br/>

Of fatal madness and delusion,<br/>

Must, sooner than a prodigy,<br/>

Portend destruction to be nigh)<br/>

Consider'd timely how t' withdraw,<br/>

And save their wind-pipes from the law;                       340<br/>

For one rencounter at the bar<br/>

Was worse than all th' had 'scap'd in war;<br/>

And therefore met in consultation<br/>

To cant and quack upon the nation;<br/>

Not for the sickly patient's sake,                            345<br/>

For what to give, but what to take;<br/>

To feel the pulses of their fees,<br/>

More wise than fumbling arteries:<br/>

Prolong the snuff of life in pain,<br/>

And from the grave recover — Gain.                           350<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00512">'Mong these there was a &lt;s&gt; politician<br/>

With more heads than a beast in vision,<br/>

And more intrigues in ev'ry one<br/>

Than all the whores of Babylon:<br/>

So politic, as if one eye                                     355<br/>

Upon the other were a spy,<br/>

That, to trepan the one to think<br/>

The other blind, both strove to blink;<br/>

And in his dark pragmatick way,<br/>

As busy as a child at play.                                   360<br/>

H' had seen three Governments run down,<br/>

And had a hand in ev'ry one;<br/>

Was for 'em and against 'em all,<br/>

But barb'rous when they came to fall<br/>

For, by trepanning th' old to ruin,                           365<br/>

He made his int'rest with the new one<br/>

Play'd true and faithful, though against<br/>

His conscience, and was still advanc'd.<br/>

For by the witchcraft of rebellion<br/>

Transform'd t' a feeble state-camelion,                       370<br/>

By giving aim from side to side,<br/>

He never fail'd to save his tide,<br/>

But got the start of ev'ry state,<br/>

And at a change ne'er came too late;<br/>

Cou'd turn his word, and oath, and faith,                     375<br/>

As many ways as in a lath;<br/>

By turning, wriggle, like a screw,<br/>

Int' highest trust, and out, for new.<br/>

For when h' had happily incurr'd,<br/>

Instead of hemp, to be preferr'd,                             380<br/>

And pass'd upon a government,<br/>

He pay'd his trick, and out he went<br/>

But, being out, and out of hopes<br/>

To mount his ladder (more) of ropes,<br/>

Wou'd strive to raise himself upon                            385<br/>

The publick ruin, and his own;<br/>

So little did he understand<br/>

The desp'rate feats he took in hand.<br/>

For when h' had got himself a name<br/>

For fraud and tricks, he spoil'd his game;                    390<br/>

Had forc'd his neck into a noose,<br/>

To shew his play at fast and loose;<br/>

And when he chanc'd t' escape, mistook<br/>

For art and subtlety, his luck.<br/>

So right his judgment was cut fit,                            395<br/>

And made a tally to his wit,<br/>

And both together most profound<br/>

At deeds of darkness under-ground;<br/>

As th' earth is easiest undermin'd<br/>

By vermin impotent and blind.                                 400<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00513">By all these arts, and many more,<br/>

H' had practis'd long and much before,<br/>

Our state artificer foresaw<br/>

Which way the world began to draw.<br/>

For as old sinners have all points                            405<br/>

O' th' compass in their bones and joints,<br/>

Can by their pangs and aches find<br/>

All turns and changes of the wind,<br/>

And better than by &lt;t&gt; NAPIER's bones<br/>

Feel in their own the age of moons;                           410<br/>

So guilty sinners in a state<br/>

Can by their crimes prognosticate,<br/>

And in their consciences feel pain<br/>

Some days before a show'r of rain.<br/>

He therefore wisely cast about,                               415<br/>

All ways he cou'd, t' ensure his throat;<br/>

And hither came, t' observe and smoke<br/>

What courses other riskers took<br/>

And to the utmost do his best<br/>

To save himself, and hang the rest.                           420<br/>

To match this Saint, there was &lt;u&gt; another<br/>

As busy and perverse a Brother,<br/>

An haberdasher of small wares<br/>

In politicks and state affairs;<br/>

More Jew than Rabbi ACHITOPHEL,                               425<br/>

And better gifted to rebel:<br/>

For when h' had taught his tribe to 'spouse<br/>

The Cause, aloft, upon one house,<br/>

He scorn'd to set his own in order,<br/>

But try'd another, and went further;                          430<br/>

So suddenly addicted still<br/>

To's only principle, his will,<br/>

That whatsoe'er it chanc'd to prove,<br/>

Nor force of argument cou'd move;<br/>

Nor law, nor cavalcade of Holborn,                            435<br/>

Could render half a grain less stubborn.<br/>

For he at any time would hang<br/>

For th' opportunity t' harangue;<br/>

And rather on a gibbet dangle,<br/>

Than miss his dear delight, to wrangle;                       440<br/>

In which his parts were so accomplisht,<br/>

That, right or wrong, he ne'er was non-plusht;<br/>

But still his tongue ran on, the less<br/>

Of weight it bore, with greater ease;<br/>

And with its everlasting clack                                445<br/>

Set all men's ears upon the rack.<br/>

No sooner cou'd a hint appear,<br/>

But up he started to picqueer,<br/>

And made the stoutest yield to mercy,<br/>

When he engag'd in controversy.                               450<br/>

Not by the force of carnal reason,<br/>

But indefatigable teazing;<br/>

With vollies of eternal babble,<br/>

And clamour, more unanswerable.<br/>

For though his topics, frail and weak,                        455<br/>

Cou'd ne'er amount above a freak,<br/>

He still maintain'd 'em, like his faults,<br/>

Against the desp'ratest assaults;<br/>

And back'd their feeble lack of sense,<br/>

With greater heat and confidence?                             460<br/>

As bones of Hectors, when they differ,<br/>

The more they're cudgel'd grow the stiffer.<br/>

Yet when his profit moderated,<br/>

The fury of his heat abated.<br/>

For nothing but his interest                                  465<br/>

Cou'd lay his Devil of Contest.<br/>

It was his choice, or chance; or curse,<br/>

T' espouse the Cause for bett'r or worse,<br/>

And with his worldly goods and wit,<br/>

And soul and body, worship'd it:                              470<br/>

But when he found the sullen trapes<br/>

Possess'd with th' Devil, worms, and claps;<br/>

The &lt;w&gt; Trojan mare, in foal with Greeks,<br/>

Not half so full of jadish tricks;<br/>

Though squeamish in her outward woman,                        475<br/>

As loose and rampant as Dol Common;<br/>

He still resolv'd to mend the matter,<br/>

T' adhere and cleave the obstinater;<br/>

And still the skittisher and looser<br/>

Her freaks appear'd, to sit the closer.                       480<br/>

For fools are stubborn in their way,<br/>

As coins are harden'd by th' allay:<br/>

And obstinacy's ne'er so stiff<br/>

As when 'tis in a wrong belief.<br/>

These two, with others, being met,                            485<br/>

And close in consultation set,<br/>

After a discontented pause,<br/>

And not without sufficient cause,<br/>

The orator we nam'd of late,<br/>

Less troubled with the pangs of State                         490<br/>

Than with his own impatience,<br/>

To give himself first audience,<br/>

After he had a while look'd wise,<br/>

At last broke silence, and the ice.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00514">Quoth he, There's nothing makes me doubt                      495<br/>

Our last out-goings brought about,<br/>

More than to see the characters<br/>

Of real jealousies and fears<br/>

Not feign'd, as once, but, sadly horrid,<br/>

Scor'd upon ev'ry Member's forehead;                          500<br/>

Who, 'cause the clouds are drawn together,<br/>

And threaten sudden change of weather,<br/>

Feel pangs and aches of state-turns,<br/>

And revolutions in their corns;<br/>

And, since our workings-out are cross'd,                      505<br/>

Throw up the Cause before 'tis lost.<br/>

Was it to run away we meant,<br/>

When, taking of the Covenant,<br/>

The lamest cripples of the brothers<br/>

Took oaths to run before all others;                          510<br/>

But in their own sense only swore<br/>

To strive to run away before;<br/>

And now would prove, that words and oath<br/>

Engage us to renounce them both?<br/>

'Tis true, the Cause is in the lurch,                         515<br/>

Between a Right and Mungrel-Church;<br/>

The Presbyter and Independent,<br/>

That stickle which shall make an end on't;<br/>

As 'twas made out to us the last<br/>

Expedient — ( I mean &lt;x&gt; Marg'ret's Fast,)                   520<br/>

When Providence had been suborn'd,<br/>

What answer was to be return'd.<br/>

Else why should tumults fright us now,<br/>

We have so many times come through?<br/>

And understand as well to tame,                               525<br/>

As when they serve our turns t'inflame:<br/>

Have prov'd how inconsiderable<br/>

Are all engagements of the rabble,<br/>

Whose frenzies must be reconcil'd<br/>

With drums and rattles, like a child;                         530<br/>

But never prov'd so prosperous<br/>

As when they were led on by us<br/>

For all our scourging of religion<br/>

Began with tumult and sedition;<br/>

When hurricanes of fierce commotion                           535<br/>

Became strong motives to devotion;<br/>

(As carnal seamen, in a storm,<br/>

Turn pious converts, and reform;)<br/>

When rusty weapons, with chalk'd edges,<br/>

Maintain'd our feeble privileges;                             540<br/>

And brown-bills levy'd in the City,<br/>

Made bills to pass the Grand Committee;<br/>

When zeal, with aged clubs and gleaves,<br/>

Gave chace to rochets and white sleeves,<br/>

And made the Church, and State, and Laws,                     545<br/>

Submit t' old iron and the Cause.<br/>

And as we thriv'd by tumults then,<br/>

So might we better now agen,<br/>

If we knew how, as then we did,<br/>

To use them rightly in our need:                              550<br/>

Tumults, by which the mutinous<br/>

Betray themselves instead of us.<br/>

The hollow-hearted, disaffected,<br/>

And close malignant are detected,<br/>

Who lay their lives and fortunes down                         555<br/>

For pledges to secure our own;<br/>

And freely sacrifice their ears<br/>

T' appease our jealousies and fears;<br/>

And yet, for all these providences<br/>

W' are offer'd, if we had our senses;                         560<br/>

We idly sit like stupid blockheads,<br/>

Our hands committed to our pockets;<br/>

And nothing but our tongues at large,<br/>

To get the wretches a discharge:<br/>

Like men condemn'd to thunder-bolts,                          565<br/>

Who, ere the blow, become mere dolts;<br/>

Or fools besotted with their crimes,<br/>

That know not how to shift betimes,<br/>

And neither have the hearts to stay,<br/>

Nor wit enough to run away;                                   570<br/>

Who, if we cou'd resolve on either,<br/>

Might stand or fall at least together;<br/>

No mean or trivial solace<br/>

To partners in extreme distress;<br/>

Who us'd to lessen their despairs,                            575<br/>

By parting them int' equal shares;<br/>

As if the more they were to bear,<br/>

They felt the weight the easier;<br/>

And ev'ry one the gentler hung,<br/>

The more he took his turn among.                              580<br/>

But 'tis not come to that, as yet,<br/>

If we had courage left, or wit;<br/>

Who, when our fate can be no worse,<br/>

Are fitted for the bravest course;<br/>

Have time to rally, and prepare                               585<br/>

Our last and best defence, despair;<br/>

Despair, by which the gallant'st feats<br/>

Have been atchiev'd in greatest straits,<br/>

And horrid'st danger safely wav'd,<br/>

By being courageously out-brav'd;                             590<br/>

As wounds by wider wounds are heal'd,<br/>

And poisons by themselves expell'd:<br/>

And so they might be now agen,<br/>

If we were, what we shou'd be, men;<br/>

And not so dully desperate,                                   595<br/>

To side against ourselves with Fate;<br/>

As criminals, condemn'd to suffer,<br/>

Are blinded first, and then turn'd over.<br/>

This comes of breaking Covenants,<br/>

And setting up Exauns of Saints,                              600<br/>

That fine, like aldermen, for grace,<br/>

To be excus'd the efficace.<br/>

For Spiritual men are too transcendent,<br/>

That mount their banks for Independent,<br/>

To hang like &lt;y&gt; MAHOMET in th' air,                          605<br/>

Or St. IGNATIUS at his prayer,<br/>

By pure geometry, and hate<br/>

Dependence upon Church or State;<br/>

Disdain the pedantry o' th' letter;<br/>

And since obedience is better                                 610<br/>

(The Scripture says) than sacrifice,<br/>

Presume the less on't will suffice;<br/>

And scorn to have the moderat'st stints<br/>

Prescrib'd their peremptory hints,<br/>

Or any opinion, true or false,                                615<br/>

Declar'd as such, in doctrinals<br/>

But left at large to make their best on,<br/>

Without b'ing call'd t' account or question,<br/>

Interpret all the spleen reveals;<br/>

As WHITTINGTON explain'd the bells;                           620<br/>

And bid themselves turn back agen<br/>

Lord May'rs of New Jerusalem;<br/>

But look so big and over-grown,<br/>

They scorn their edifiers t' own,<br/>

Who taught them all their sprinkling lessons,                 625<br/>

Their tones, and sanctified expressions<br/>

Bestow'd their Gifts upon a Saint,<br/>

Like Charity on those that want;<br/>

And learn'd th' apocryphal bigots<br/>

T' inspire themselves with short-hand notes;                  630<br/>

For which they scorn and hate them worse<br/>

Than dogs and cats do sow-gelders.<br/>

For who first bred them up to pray,<br/>

And teach, the House of Commons Way?<br/>

Where had they all their gifted phrases,                      635<br/>

But from our CALAMYS and CASES?<br/>

Without whose sprinkling and sowing,<br/>

Who e'er had heard of NYE or OWEN?<br/>

Their dispensations had been stifled,<br/>

But for our ADONIRAM BYFIELD;                                 640<br/>

And had they not begun the war,<br/>

Th' had ne'er been sainted, as they are:<br/>

For Saints in peace degenerate,<br/>

And dwindle down to reprobate;<br/>

Their zeal corrupts, like standing water,                     645<br/>

In th' intervals of war and slaughter;<br/>

Abates the sharpness of its edge,<br/>

Without the power of sacrilege.<br/>

And though they've tricks to cast their sins<br/>

As easy as &lt;z&gt; serpents do their skins,                       650<br/>

That in a while grow out agen,<br/>

In peace they turn mere carnal men,<br/>

And from the most refin'd of saints,<br/>

As naturally grow miscreants,<br/>

As &lt;a&gt; barnacles turn SOLAND geese                            655<br/>

In th' Islands of the ORCADES.<br/>

Their dispensation's but a ticket,<br/>

For their conforming to the wicked;<br/>

With whom the greatest difference<br/>

Lies more in words, and shew, than sense.                     660<br/>

For as the Pope, that keeps the gate<br/>

Of Heaven, wears three crowns of state;<br/>

So he that keeps the gate of Hell,<br/>

Proud &lt;b&gt; CERBERUS, wears three heads as well;<br/>

And if the world has any troth                                665<br/>

Some have been canoniz'd in both.<br/>

But that which does them greatest harm,<br/>

Their spiritual gizzards are too warm,<br/>

Which puts the over-heated sots<br/>

In fevers still, like other goats.                            670<br/>

For though the Whore bends Hereticks<br/>

With flames of fire, like crooked sticks,<br/>

Our Schismaticks so vastly differ,<br/>

Th' hotter th' are, they grow the stiffer;<br/>

Still setting off their spiritual goods                       675<br/>

With fierce and pertinacious feuds.<br/>

For zeal's a dreadful termagant,<br/>

That teaches Saints to tear and rant,<br/>

And Independents to profess<br/>

The doctrine of dependences:                                  680<br/>

Turns meek, and secret, sneaking ones,<br/>

To raw-heads fierce and bloody-bones:<br/>

And, not content with endless quarrels<br/>

Against the wicked, and their morals,<br/>

The &lt;c&gt; GIBELLINES, for want of GUELPHS,                      685<br/>

Divert their rage upon themselves.<br/>

For now the war is not between<br/>

The Brethren and the Men of Sin,<br/>

But Saint and Saint, to spill the blood<br/>

Of one another's brotherhood;                                 690<br/>

Where neither side can lay pretence<br/>

To liberty of conscience,<br/>

Or zealous suff'ring for the cause,<br/>

To gain one groat's-worth of applause;<br/>

For though endur'd with resolution,                           695<br/>

'Twill ne'er amount to persecution.<br/>

Shall precious Saints, and secret ones,<br/>

Break one another's outward bones,<br/>

And eat the flesh of Brethren,<br/>

Instead of Kings and mighty men?                              700<br/>

When fiends agree among themselves,<br/>

Shall they be found the greatest elves?<br/>

When BELL's at union with the DRAGON,<br/>

And BAAL-PEOR friends with DAGON,<br/>

When savage bears agree with bears,                           705<br/>

Shall secret ones lug Saints by th' ears,<br/>

And not atone their fatal wrath,<br/>

When common danger threatens both?<br/>

Shall mastiffs, by the coller pull'd,<br/>

Engag'd with bulls, let go their hold,                        710<br/>

And Saints, whose necks are pawn'd at stake,<br/>

No notice of the danger take?<br/>

But though no pow'r of Heav'n or Hell<br/>

Can pacify phanatick zeal,<br/>

Who wou'd not guess there might be hopes,                     715<br/>

The fear of gallowses and ropes,<br/>

Before their eyes, might reconcile<br/>

Their animosities a while;<br/>

At least until th' had a clear stage,<br/>

And equal freedom to engage,                                  720<br/>

Without the danger of surprize<br/>

By both our common enemies?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00515">This none but we alone cou'd doubt,<br/>

Who understand their workings out;<br/>

And know them, both in soul and conscience,                   725<br/>

Giv'n up t' as reprobate a nonsense<br/>

As spiritual out-laws, whom the pow'r<br/>

Of miracle can ne'er restore<br/>

We, whom at first they set up under,<br/>

In revelation only of plunder,                                730<br/>

Who since have had so many trials<br/>

Of their encroaching self-denials,<br/>

That rook'd upon us with design<br/>

To out-reform, and undermine;<br/>

Took all our interest and commands                            735<br/>

Perfidiously out of our hands;<br/>

Involv'd us in the guilt of blood<br/>

Without the motive gains allow'd,<br/>

And made us serve as ministerial,<br/>

Like younger Sons of Father BELIAL;                           740<br/>

And yet, for all th' inhuman wrong<br/>

Th' had done us and the Cause so long,<br/>

We never fail to carry on<br/>

The work still as we had begun;<br/>

But true and faithfully obey'd                                745<br/>

And neither preach'd them hurt, nor pray'd;<br/>

Nor troubled them to crop our ears,<br/>

Nor hang us like the cavaliers;<br/>

Nor put them to the charge of gaols,<br/>

To find us pill'ries and cart's-tails,                        750<br/>

Or hangman's wages, which the State<br/>

Was forc'd (before them) to be at,<br/>

That cut, like tallies, to the stumps,<br/>

Our ears for keeping true accompts,<br/>

And burnt our vessels, like a new                             755<br/>

Seal'd peck, or bushel, for b'ing true;<br/>

But hand in hand, like faithful brothers,<br/>

Held for the Cause against all others,<br/>

Disdaining equally to yield<br/>

One syllable of what we held,                                 760<br/>

And though we differ'd now and then<br/>

'Bout outward things, and outward men,<br/>

Our inward men, and constant frame<br/>

Of spirit, still were near the same;<br/>

And till they first began to cant                             765<br/>

And sprinkle down the Covenant,<br/>

We ne'er had call in any place,<br/>

Nor dream'd of teaching down free grace,<br/>

But join'd our gifts perpetually<br/>

Against the common enemy.                                     770<br/>

Although 'twas ours and their opinion,<br/>

Each other's Church was but a RIMMON;<br/>

And yet, for all this gospel-union,<br/>

And outward shew of Church-communion,<br/>

They'll ne'er admit us to our shares                          775<br/>

Of ruling Church or State affairs;<br/>

Nor give us leave t' absolve, or sentence<br/>

T' our own conditions of repentance;<br/>

But shar'd our dividend o' th' Crown,<br/>

We had so painfully preach'd down;                            780<br/>

And forc'd us, though against the grain,<br/>

T' have calls to teach it up again:<br/>

For 'twas but justice to restore<br/>

The wrongs we had receiv'd before;<br/>

And when 'twas held forth in our way,                         785<br/>

W' had been ungrateful not to pay;<br/>

Who, for the right w' have done the nation,<br/>

Have earn'd our temporal salvation;<br/>

And put our vessels in a way<br/>

Once more to come again in play.                              790<br/>

For if the turning of us out<br/>

Has brought this Providence about,<br/>

And that our only suffering<br/>

Is able to bring in the King,<br/>

What would our actions not have done,                         795<br/>

Had we been suffer'd to go on?<br/>

And therefore may pretend t' a share,<br/>

At least; in carrying on th' affair.<br/>

But whether that be so, or not,<br/>

W' have done enough to have it thought;                       800<br/>

And that's as good as if w' had done't,<br/>

And easier pass't upon account:<br/>

For if it be but half deny'd,<br/>

'Tis half as good as justifi'd.<br/>

The world is nat'rally averse                                 805<br/>

To all the truth it sees or hears<br/>

But swallows nonsense, and a lie,<br/>

With greediness and gluttony<br/>

And though it have the pique, and long,<br/>

'Tis still for something in the wrong;                        810<br/>

As women long, when they're with child,<br/>

For things extravagant and wild;<br/>

For meats ridiculous and fulsome,<br/>

But seldom any thing that's wholesome;<br/>

And, like the world, men's jobbernoles                        815<br/>

Turn round upon their ears, the poles;<br/>

And what they're confidently told,<br/>

By no sense else can be control'd.<br/>

And this, perhaps, may prove time means<br/>

Once more to hedge-in Providence,                             820<br/>

For as relapses make diseases<br/>

More desp'rate than their first accesses,<br/>

If we but get again in pow'r,<br/>

Our work is easier than before<br/>

And we more ready and expert                                  825<br/>

I' th' mystery to do our part.<br/>

We, who did rather undertake<br/>

The first war to create than make,<br/>

And when of nothing 'twas begun,<br/>

Rais'd funds as strange to carry 't on;                       830<br/>

Trepann'd the State, and fac'd it down<br/>

With plots and projects of our own;<br/>

And if we did such feats at first,<br/>

What can we now we're better vers'd?<br/>

Who have a freer latitude,                                    835<br/>

Than sinners give themselves, allow'd,<br/>

And therefore likeliest to bring in,<br/>

On fairest terms, our discipline;<br/>

To which it was reveal'd long since,<br/>

We were ordain'd by Providence;                               840<br/>

When &lt;d&gt; three Saints Ears, our predecessors,<br/>

The Cause's primitive Confessors,<br/>

B'ing crucify'd, the nation stood<br/>

In just so many years of blood;<br/>

That, multiply'd by six, exprest                              845<br/>

The perfect number of the beast,<br/>

And prov'd that we must be the men<br/>

To bring this work about agen;<br/>

And those who laid the first foundation,<br/>

Compleat the thorough Reformation:                            850<br/>

For who have gifts to carry on<br/>

So great a work, but we alone?<br/>

What churches have such able pastors,<br/>

And precious, powerful, preaching masters?<br/>

Possess'd with absolute dominions                             855<br/>

O'er brethren's purses and opinions?<br/>

And trusted with the double keys<br/>

Of Heaven and their warehouses;<br/>

Who, when the Cause is in distress,<br/>

Can furnish out what sums they please,                        860<br/>

That brooding lie in bankers' hands,<br/>

To be dispos'd at their commands;<br/>

And daily increase and multiply,<br/>

With doctrine, use, and usury:<br/>

Can fetch in parties (as in war                               865<br/>

All other heads of cattle are)<br/>

From th' enemy of all religions,<br/>

As well as high and low conditions,<br/>

And share them, from blue ribbands, down<br/>

To all blue aprons in the town;                               870<br/>

From ladies hurried in calleches,<br/>

With cor'nets at their footmens' breeches,<br/>

To bawds as fat as Mother Nab;<br/>

All guts and belly, like a crab.<br/>

Our party's great, and better ty'd                            875<br/>

With oaths and trade than any side,<br/>

Has one considerable improvement,<br/>

To double fortify the Cov'nant:<br/>

I mean our Covenant to purchase<br/>

Delinquents titles, and the Churches;                         880<br/>

That pass in sale, from hand to hand,<br/>

Among ourselves, for current land;<br/>

And rise or fall, like Indian actions,<br/>

According to the rate of factions<br/>

Our best reserve for Reformation,                             885<br/>

When new out-goings give occasion;<br/>

That keeps the loins of Brethren girt<br/>

The Covenant (their creed) t' assert;<br/>

And when th' have pack'd a Parliament,<br/>

Will once more try th' expedient:                             890<br/>

Who can already muster friends,<br/>

To serve for members, to our ends,<br/>

That represent no part o' th' nation,<br/>

But &lt;e&gt; Fisher's-Folly Congregation;<br/>

Are only tools to our intrigues,                              895<br/>

And sit like geese to hatch our eggs;<br/>

Who, by their precedents of wit,<br/>

T' out-fast, out-loiter, and out-sit,<br/>

Can order matters underhand,<br/>

To put all bus'ness to a stand;                               900<br/>

Lay publick bills aside for private,<br/>

And make 'em one another drive out;<br/>

Divert the great and necessary,<br/>

With trifles to contest and vary;<br/>

And make the Ration represent,                                905<br/>

And serve for us, in Parliament<br/>

Cut out more work than can be done.<br/>

In &lt;f&gt; PLATO'S year, but finish none;<br/>

Unless it be the Bulls of LENTHAL,<br/>

That always pass'd for fundamental;                           910<br/>

Can set up grandee against grandee,<br/>

To squander time away, and bandy;<br/>

Make Lords and Commoners lay sieges<br/>

To one another's privileges,<br/>

And, rather than compound the quarrel,                        915<br/>

Engage to th' inevitable peril<br/>

Of both their ruins; th' only scope<br/>

And consolation of our hope;<br/>

Who though we do not play the game,<br/>

Assist as much by giving aim:                                 920<br/>

Can introduce our ancient arts,<br/>

For heads of factions t' act their parts;<br/>

Know what a leading voice is worth,<br/>

A seconding, a third, or fourth<br/>

How much a casting voice comes to,                            925<br/>

That turns up trump, of ay, or no;<br/>

And, by adjusting all at th' end,<br/>

Share ev'ry one his dividend<br/>

An art that so much study cost,<br/>

And now's in danger to be lost,                               930<br/>

Unless our ancient virtuosos,<br/>

That found it out, get into th' Houses.<br/>

These are the courses that we took<br/>

To carry things by hook or crook;<br/>

And practis'd down from forty-four,                           935<br/>

Until they turn'd us out of door<br/>

Besides the herds of Boutefeus<br/>

We set on work without the House;<br/>

When ev'ry knight and citizen<br/>

Kept legislative journeymen,                                  940<br/>

To bring them in intelligence<br/>

From all points of the rabble's sense,<br/>

And fill the lobbies of both Houses<br/>

With politick important buzzes:<br/>

Set committees of cabals,                                     945<br/>

To pack designs without the walls;<br/>

Examine, and draw up all news,<br/>

And fit it to our present use.<br/>

Agree upon the plot o' th' farce,<br/>

And ev'ry one his part rehearse,                              950<br/>

Make Q's of answers, to way-lay<br/>

What th' other pasties like to say<br/>

What repartees, and smart reflections,<br/>

Shall be return'd to all objections;<br/>

And who shall break the master-jest,                          955<br/>

And what, and how, upon the rest<br/>

Held pamphlets out, with safe editions,<br/>

Of proper slanders and seditions;<br/>

And treason for a token send,<br/>

By Letter to a Country Friend;                                960<br/>

Disperse lampoons, the only wit<br/>

That men, like burglary, commit;<br/>

Wit falser than a padder's face,<br/>

That all its owner does betrays;<br/>

Who therefore dares not trust it when                         965<br/>

He's in his calling to be seen;<br/>

Disperse the dung on barren earth,<br/>

To bring new weeds of discord forth;<br/>

Be sure to keep up congregations,<br/>

In spight of laws and proclamations:                          970<br/>

For Charlatans can do no good<br/>

Until they're mounted in a crowd;<br/>

And when they're punish'd, all the hurt<br/>

Is but to fare the better for't;<br/>

As long as confessors are sure                                975<br/>

Of double pay for all th' endure;<br/>

And what they earn in persecution,<br/>

Are paid t' a groat in contribution.<br/>

Whence some Tub-Holders-forth have made<br/>

In powd'ring-tubs their richest trade;                        980<br/>

And while they kept their shops in prison,<br/>

Have found their prices strangely risen.<br/>

Disdain to own the least regret<br/>

For all the Christian blood w' have let;<br/>

'Twill save our credit, and maintain                          985<br/>

Our title to do so again;<br/>

That needs not cost one dram of sense,<br/>

But pertinacious impudence.<br/>

Our constancy t' our principles,<br/>

In time will wear out all things else;                        990<br/>

Like marble statues rubb'd in pieces<br/>

With gallantry of pilgrims' kisses;<br/>

While those who turn and wind their oaths,<br/>

Have swell'd and sunk, like other froths;<br/>

Prevail'd a while, but 'twas not long                         995<br/>

Before from world to world they swung:<br/>

As they had turn'd from side to side,<br/>

And as the changelings liv'd, they dy'd.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00516">This said, th' impatient States-monger<br/>

Could now contain himself no longer;                         1000<br/>

Who had not spar'd to shew his piques<br/>

Against th' haranguer's politicks,<br/>

With smart remarks of leering faces,<br/>

And annotations of grimaces.<br/>

After h' had administer'd a dose                             1005<br/>

Of snuff-mundungus to his nose,<br/>

And powder'd th' inside of his skull,<br/>

Instead of th' outward jobbernol,<br/>

He shook it with a scornful look<br/>

On th' adversary, and thus he spoke:                         1010<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00517">In dressing a calves head, although<br/>

The tongue and brains together go,<br/>

Both keep so great a distance here,<br/>

'Tis strange if ever they come near;<br/>

For who did ever play his gambols                            1015<br/>

With such insufferable rambles<br/>

To make the bringing in the KING,<br/>

And keeping of him out, one thing?<br/>

Which none could do, but those that swore<br/>

T' as point-plank nonsense heretofore:                       1020<br/>

That to defend, was to invade;<br/>

And to assassinate, to aid<br/>

Unless, because you drove him out,<br/>

(And that was never made a doubt,)<br/>

No pow'r is able to restore,                                 1025<br/>

And bring him in, but on your score<br/>

A spiritual doctrine, that conduces<br/>

Most properly to all your uses.<br/>

'Tis true, a scorpions oil is said<br/>

To cure the wounds the vermine made;                         1030<br/>

And weapons, drest with salves, restore<br/>

And heal the hurts they gave before;<br/>

But whether Presbyterians have<br/>

So much good nature as the salve,<br/>

Or virtue in them as the vermine,                            1035<br/>

Those who have try'd them can determine.<br/>

Indeed, 'th pity you should miss<br/>

Th' arrears of all your services,<br/>

And for th' eternal obligation<br/>

Y' have laid upon th' ungrateful nation,                     1040<br/>

Be us'd so unconscionably hard,<br/>

As not to find a just reward,<br/>

For letting rapine loose, and murther,<br/>

To rage just so far, but no further;<br/>

And setting all the land on fire,                            1045<br/>

To burn't to a scantling, but no higher;<br/>

For vent'ring to assassinate,<br/>

And cut the throats, of Church and State,<br/>

And not be allow'd the fittest men<br/>

To take the charge of both agen:                             1050<br/>

Especially, that have the grace<br/>

Of self-denying, gifted face;<br/>

Who when your projects have miscarry'd,<br/>

Can lay them, with undaunted forehead,<br/>

On those you painfully trepann'd,                            1055<br/>

And sprinkled in at second hand;<br/>

As we have been, to share the guilt<br/>

Of Christian Blood, devoutly spilt;<br/>

For so our ignorance was flamm'd<br/>

To damn ourselves, t' avoid being damn'd;                    1060<br/>

Till finding your old foe, the hangman,<br/>

Was like to lurch you at back-gammon<br/>

And win your necks upon the set,<br/>

As well as ours, who did but bet,<br/>

(For he had drawn your ears before,                          1065<br/>

And nick'd them on the self-same score,)<br/>

We threw the box and dice away,<br/>

Before y' had lost us, at foul play;<br/>

And brought you down to rook, and lie,<br/>

And fancy only, on the by;                                   1070<br/>

Redeem'd your forfeit jobbernoles<br/>

From perching upon lofty poles;<br/>

And rescu'd all your outward traitors<br/>

From hanging up like aligators;<br/>

For which ingeniously y' have shew'd                         1075<br/>

Your Presbyterian gratitude:<br/>

Would freely have paid us home in kind,<br/>

And not have been one rope behind.<br/>

Those were your motives to divide,<br/>

And scruple, on the other side.                              1080<br/>

To turn your zealous frauds, and force,<br/>

To fits of conscience and remorse;<br/>

To be convinc'd they were in vain,<br/>

And face about for new again;<br/>

For truth no more unveil'd your eyes,                        1085<br/>

Than maggots are convinc'd to flies<br/>

And therefore all your lights and calls<br/>

Are but apocryphal and false,<br/>

To charge us with the consequences<br/>

Of all your native insolences,                               1090<br/>

That to your own imperious wills<br/>

Laid Law and Gospel neck and heels;<br/>

Corrupted the Old Testament,<br/>

To serve the New for precedent<br/>

T' amend its errors, and defects,                            1095<br/>

With murther, and rebellion texts;<br/>

Of which there is not any one<br/>

In all the Book to sow upon<br/>

And therefore (from your tribe) the Jews<br/>

Held Christian doctrine forth, and use;                      1100<br/>

As Mahomet (your chief) began<br/>

To mix them in the Alchoran:<br/>

Denounc'd and pray'd, with fierce devotion,<br/>

And bended elbows on the cushion;<br/>

Stole from the beggars all your tones,                       1105<br/>

And gifted mortifying groans;<br/>

Had Lights where better eyes were blind,<br/>

As pigs are said to see the wind<br/>

Fill'd Bedlam with predestination,<br/>

And Knights-bridge with illumination:                        1110<br/>

Made children, with your tones, to run for't,<br/>

As bad as bloody-bones, or LUNSFORD:<br/>

While women, great with child, miscarry'd,<br/>

For being to malignants marry'd<br/>

Transform'd all wives to DALILAHS                            1115<br/>

Whose husbands were not for the Cause;<br/>

And turn'd the men to ten horn'd cattle,<br/>

Because they came not out to battle<br/>

Made taylors' prentices turn heroes,<br/>

For fear of being transform'd to MEROZ:                      1120<br/>

And rather forfeit their indentures,<br/>

Than not espouse the Saints' adventures.<br/>

Could transubstantiate, metamorphose,<br/>

And charm whole herds of beasts, like Orpheus;<br/>

Inchant the King's and Churches lands                        1125<br/>

T' obey and follow your commands;<br/>

And settle on a new freehold,<br/>

As MARCLY-HILL had done of old:<br/>

Could turn the Covenant, and translate<br/>

The gospel into spoons and plate:                            1130<br/>

Expound upon all merchants' cashes,<br/>

And open th' intricatest places<br/>

Could catechize a money-box,<br/>

And prove all powches orthodox;<br/>

Until the Cause became a DAMON,                              1135<br/>

And PYTHIAS the wicked Mammon.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00518">And yet, in spight of all your charms<br/>

To conjure legion up in arms,<br/>

And raise more devils in the rout<br/>

Have made it plain, they have more wit;<br/>

By whom y' have been so oft trepann'd,                       1145<br/>

And held forth out of all command,<br/>

Out-gifted, out-impuls'd, out-done,<br/>

And out-reveal'd at carryings-on;<br/>

Of all your dispensations worm'd,<br/>

Out-Providenc'd, and out-reform'd;                           1150<br/>

Ejected out of Church and State,<br/>

And all things, but the peoples' hate;<br/>

And spirited out of th' enjoyments<br/>

Of precious, edifying employments,<br/>

By those who lodg'd their Gifts and Graces,                  1155<br/>

Like better bowlers, in your places;<br/>

All which you bore with resolution,<br/>

Charg'd on th' accompt of persecution;<br/>

And though most righteously opprest,<br/>

Against your wills, still acquiesc'd;                        1160<br/>

And never hum'd and hah'd sedition,<br/>

Nor snuffled treason, nor misprision.<br/>

That is, because you never durst;<br/>

For had you preach'd and pray'd your worst,<br/>

Alas! you were no longer able                                1165<br/>

To raise your posse of the rabble:<br/>

One single red-coat centinel<br/>

Out-charm'd the magick of the spell;<br/>

And, with his squirt-fire, could disperse<br/>

Whole troops with chapter rais'd and verse.                  1170<br/>

We knew too well those tricks of yours,<br/>

To leave it ever in your powers;<br/>

Or trust our safeties, or undoings,<br/>

To your disposing of out-goings;<br/>

Or to your ordering Providence,                              1175<br/>

One farthing's-worth of consequence.<br/>

For had you pow'r to undermine,<br/>

Or wit to carry a design,<br/>

Or correspondence to trepan,<br/>

Inveigle, or betray one man,                                 1180<br/>

There's nothing else that intervenes,<br/>

And bars your zeal to use the means<br/>

And therefore wond'rous like, no doubt,<br/>

To bring in Kings, or keep them out.<br/>

Brave undertakers to restore,                                1185<br/>

That cou'd not keep yourselves in pow'r;<br/>

<p id="id00519">'Tis true, you have (for I'd be loth<br/>

To wrong ye) done your parts in both,                        1190<br/>

As grace is introduc'd by sin;<br/>

For 'twas your zealous want of sense,<br/>

And sanctify'd impertinence,<br/>

Your carrying business in a huddle,                          1195<br/>

Oblig'd the State to tack about,<br/>

Divided into other hands,<br/>

Their midnight juntos, and seal'd knots<br/>

That thrive more by your zealous piques,<br/>

Else frogs and toads, that croak'd the Jews<br/>

From PHARAOH and his brick-kilns loose,<br/>

And flies and mange, that set them free<br/>

From task-masters and slavery,<br/>

Were likelier to do the feat,                                1225<br/>

In any indiff'rent man's conceit<br/>

For who e'er heard of restoration<br/>

Until your thorough Reformation?<br/>

That is, the King's and Churches' land<br/>

Were sequester'd int' other hands:                           1230<br/>

For only then, and not before,<br/>

Your eyes were open'd to restore.<br/>

And when the work was carrying on,<br/>

Who cross'd it, but yourselves alone?<br/>

As by a world of hints appears,                              1235<br/>

All plain and extant as your ears.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00520">But first, o' th' first: The Isle of WIGHT<br/>

Will rise up, if you should deny't;<br/>

Where HENDERSON, and th' other masses,<br/>

Were sent to cap texts, and put cases;                       1240<br/>

To pass for deep and learned scholars,<br/>

Although but paltry &lt;h&gt; Ob and Sollers:<br/>

As if th' unseasonable fools<br/>

Had been a coursing in the schools;<br/>

Until th' had prov'd the Devil author                        1245<br/>

O' th' Covenant, and the Cause his daughter,<br/>

For when they charg'd him with the guilt<br/>

Of all the blood that had been spilt,<br/>

They did not mean he wrought th' effusion,<br/>

In person, like &lt;i&gt; Sir PRIDE, or HUGHSON,                   1250<br/>

But only those who first begun<br/>

The quarrel were by him set on;<br/>

And who could those be but the Saints,<br/>

Those Reformation Termagants?<br/>

But e'er this pass'd, the wise debate                        1255<br/>

Spent so much time, it grew too late;<br/>

For OLIVER had gotten ground,<br/>

T' inclose him with his warriors round<br/>

Had brought his Providence about,<br/>

And turn'd th' untimely sophists out,                        1260<br/>

Nor had the UXBRIDGE bus'ness less<br/>

Of nonsense in't, or sottishness,<br/>

When from a scoundrel Holder-forth,<br/>

The scum as well as son o' th' earth,<br/>

Your mighty Senators took law;                               1265<br/>

At his command, were forc'd t' withdraw,<br/>

And sacrifice the peace o' th' nation<br/>

To doctrine, use and application.<br/>

So when the SCOTS, your constant cronies,<br/>

Th' espousers of your Cause and monies,                      1270<br/>

Who had so often, in your aid,<br/>

So many ways been soundly paid,<br/>

Came in at last for better ends,<br/>

To prove themselves your trusty friends,<br/>

You basely left them, and the Church                         1275<br/>

They train'd you up to, in the lurch,<br/>

And suffer'd your own tribe of Christians<br/>

To fall before, as true Philistines.<br/>

This shews what utensils y' have been,<br/>

To bring the King's concernments in;                         1280<br/>

Which is so far from being true,<br/>

That none but he can bring in you:<br/>

And if he take you into trust,<br/>

Will find you most exactly just:<br/>

Such as will punctually repay                                1285<br/>

With double interest, and betray.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00521">Not that I think those pantomimes,<br/>

Who vary action with the times,<br/>

Are less ingenious in their art,<br/>

Than those who dully act one part;                           1290<br/>

Or those who turn from side to side,<br/>

More guilty than the wind and tide.<br/>

All countries are a wise man's home,<br/>

And so are governments to some,<br/>

Who change them for the same intrigues                       1295<br/>

That statesmen use in breaking leagues;<br/>

While others, in old faiths and troths,<br/>

Look odd as out-of-fashion'd cloths;<br/>

And nastier in an old opinion,<br/>

Than those who never shift their linnen.                     1300<br/>

To use the necessary means;                                  1310<br/>

And not your usual stratagems<br/>

On one another, Lights and Dreams<br/>

To stand on terms as positive,<br/>

As if we did not take, but give:<br/>

Set up the Covenant on crutches,                             1315<br/>

'Gainst those who have us in their clutches,<br/>

Without the carnal mans of heeding;                          1320<br/>

Who 'twixt your inward sense and outward,<br/>

I grant, all courses are in vain,<br/>

Unless we can get in again;<br/>

The only way that's left us now;                             1325<br/>

But all the difficulty's, How?<br/>

'Tis true, w' have money, th' only pow 'r<br/>

That all mankind falls down before;<br/>

Money, that, like the swords of kings,<br/>

Is the last reason of all things;                            1330<br/>

And therefore need not doubt our play<br/>

Has all advantages that way;<br/>

As long as men have faith to sell,<br/>

And meet with those that can pay well;<br/>

Whose half-starv'd pride, and avarice,                       1335<br/>

One Church and State will not suffice<br/>

T' expose to sale, beside the wages<br/>

Of storing plagues to after-ages.<br/>

Nor is our money less our own,<br/>

Than 'twas before we laid it down;                           1340<br/>

For 'twill return, and turn t' account,<br/>

If we are brought, in play upon't:<br/>

Or but, by casting knaves, get in,<br/>

What pow 'r can hinder us to win?<br/>

We know the arts we us'd before,                             1345<br/>

In peace and war, and something more;<br/>

And by th' unfortunate events,<br/>

Can mend our next experiments:<br/>

For when w' are taken into trust,<br/>

How easy are the wisest choust?                              1350<br/>

Who see but th' outsides of our feats,<br/>

And not their secret springs and weights;<br/>

And while they're busy at their ease,<br/>

Can carry what designs we please.<br/>

How easy is it to serve for agents,                          1355<br/>

To prosecute our old engagements?<br/>

To keep the Good Old Cause on foot,<br/>

And present power from taking root?<br/>

Inflame them both with false alarms<br/>

Of plots and parties taking arms;                            1360<br/>

To keep the Nation's wounds too wide<br/>

From healing up of side to side;<br/>

Profess the passionat'st concerns<br/>

For both their interests by turns;<br/>

The only way to improve our own,                             1365<br/>

By dealing faithfully with none;<br/>

(As bowls run true, by being made<br/>

On purpose false, and to be sway'd:)<br/>

For if we should be true to either,<br/>

'Twould turn us out of both together;                        1370<br/>

And therefore have no other means<br/>

To stand upon our own defence,<br/>

But keeping up our ancient party<br/>

In vigour, confident and hearty:<br/>

To reconcile our late dissenters,                            1375<br/>

Our brethren, though by other venters;<br/>

Unite them, and their different maggots,<br/>

As long and short sticks are in faggots,<br/>

And make them join again as close<br/>

As when they first began t' espouse;                         1380<br/>

Erect them into separate<br/>

New Jewish tribes, in Church and State;<br/>

To join in marriage and commerce,<br/>

And only among themselves converse;<br/>

And all that are not of their mind,                          1385<br/>

Make enemies to all mankind:<br/>

Take all religions in and stickle<br/>

From Conclave down to Conventicle;<br/>

Agreeing still, or disagreeing,<br/>

According to the Light in being.                             1390<br/>

Sometimes for liberty of conscience,<br/>

And spiritual mis-rule, in one sense;<br/>

But in another quite contrary,<br/>

As dispensations chance to vary;<br/>

And stand for, as the times will bear it,                    1395<br/>

All contradictions of the Spirit:<br/>

Protect their emissaries, empower'd<br/>

To preach sedition and the word;<br/>

And when they're hamper'd by the laws,<br/>

Release the lab'rers for the Cause,                          1400<br/>

And turn the persecution back<br/>

On those that made the first attack;<br/>

To keep them equally in awe,<br/>

From breaking or maintaining law:<br/>

And when they have their fits too soon,                      1405<br/>

Before the full-tides of the moon,<br/>

Put off their zeal t' a fitter season<br/>

For sowing faction in and treason;<br/>

And keep them hooded, and their Churches,<br/>

Like hawks from baiting on their perches,                    1410<br/>

That, when the blessed time shall come<br/>

Of quitting BABYLON and ROME,<br/>

They may be ready to restore<br/>

Their own Fifth Monarchy once more.<br/>

Authority as men in want;<br/>

As some of us, in trusts, have made<br/>

The means to turn and wind a trade:                          1450<br/>

And though some change it for the worse,<br/>

They put themselves into a course;<br/>

And draw in store of customers,<br/>

To thrive the better in commerce:<br/>

For all Religions flock together,                            1455<br/>

Like tame and wild fowl of a feather;<br/>

To nab the itches of their sects,<br/>

As jades do one another's necks.<br/>

Hence 'tis, Hypocrisy as well<br/>

Will serve t' improve a Church as ZEAL:                      1460<br/>

For 'tis more easy to betray,<br/>

In all their politick far-fetches,<br/>

And from the Coptick Priest, &lt;o&gt; Kircherus,                  1585<br/>

Found out this mystick way to jeer us.<br/>

Condemn'd t' ungoverning distress,                           1635<br/>

And paultry, private wretchedness;<br/>

Worse than the Devil, to privation,<br/>

Beyond all hopes of restoration;<br/>

And parted, like the body and soul,<br/>

From all dominion and controul.                              1640<br/>

We, who cou'd lately with a look<br/>

Enact, establish, or revoke;<br/>

Whose arbitrary nods gave law,<br/>

And frowns kept multitudes in awe;<br/>

Before the bluster of whose huff,                            1645<br/>

All hats, as in a storm, flew off;<br/>

Ador'd and bowed to by the great,<br/>

Down to the footman and valet;<br/>

Had more bent knees than chapel-mats,<br/>

And prayers than the crowns of hats;                         1650<br/>

Shall now be scorn'd as wretchedly;<br/>

For ruin's just as low as high;<br/>

Which might be suffer'd, were it all<br/>

The horror that attends our fall:<br/>

For some of us have scores more large                        1655<br/>

Than heads and quarters can discharge;<br/>

And others, who, by restless scraping,<br/>

With publick frauds, and private rapine,<br/>

Have mighty heaps of wealth amass'd,<br/>

Would gladly lay down all at last;                           1660<br/>

And to be but undone, entail<br/>

Their vessels on perpetual jail;<br/>

And bless the Dev'l to let them farms<br/>

Of forfeit souls on no worse terms.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00535">This said, a near and louder shout                           1665<br/>

Put all th' assembly to the rout,<br/>

Who now begun t' out-run their fear,<br/>

As horses do from whom they bear;<br/>

But crowded on with so mach haste,<br/>

Until th' had block'd the passage fast,                      1670<br/>

And barricado'd it with haunches<br/>

Of outward men, and bulks, and paunches,<br/>

That with their shoulders strove to squeeze,<br/>

And rather save a crippled piece<br/>

Of all their crush'd and broken members,                     1675<br/>

Than have them grilled on the embers;<br/>

Still pressing on with heavy packs<br/>

Of one another on their backs:<br/>

The van-guard could no longer hear<br/>

The charges of the forlorn rear,                             1680<br/>

But, born down headlong by the rout,<br/>

Were trampled sorely under foot:<br/>

Yet nothing prov'd so formidable<br/>

As the horrid cookery of the rabble;<br/>

And fear, that keeps all feeling out,                        1685<br/>

As lesser pains are by the gout,<br/>

Reliev'd 'em with a fresh supply<br/>

Of rallied force enough to fly,<br/>

And beat a Tuscan running-horse,<br/>

Whose jockey-rider is all spurs.                             1690<br/>

<h3 id="id00536" style="margin-top: 3em">NOTES TO PART III. CANTO II.</h3>

<p id="id00537" style="margin-top: 2em">1 g The Learned write, &amp;c.] An insect breeze. Breezes often
bring along with them great quantities of insects, which some
are of opinion, are generated from viscous exhalations in the air;
but our Author makes them proceed from a cow's dung, and
afterwards become a plague to that whence it received its
original.</p>

<p id="id00538">13 h For as the Persian, &amp;c.] The Magi were priests and
philosophers among the Persians, intrusted with the government
both civil and ecclesiastick, much addicted to the observation of
the stars. Zoroaster is reported to be their first author. They had
this custom amongst them, to preserve and continue their
families by incestuous copulation with their own mothers. Some
are of opinion, that the three wise men that came out of the East
to worship our Saviour were some of these.</p>

<p id="id00539">51 i At Michael's Term, &amp;c.] St. Michael, an archangel;
mentioned in St. Jude's Epistle, Verse 9.</p>

<p id="id00540">78 k And laid about, &amp;c.] William Prynne, of Lincoln's-Inn,
Esq. born at Swanswick, who stiled himself Utter Barrister, a
very warm person, and voluminous writer; and after the
Restoration, keeper of the records in the Tower.</p>

<p id="id00541">146 l As Dutch Boors, &amp;c.] It is reported of the Dutch women,
that making so great use of stoves, and often putting them under
their petticoats, they engender a kind of ugly monster, which is
called a Sooterkin.</p>

<p id="id00542">151 m T' out-cant the Babylonian, &amp;c.] At the building of the
Tower of Babel, when God made the confusion of languages.</p>

<p id="id00543">215 Toss'd in a furious Hurricane, &amp;c.] At Oliver's death was a
most furious tempest, such as had not been known in the
memory of man, or hardly ever recorded to have been in this
nation. This Sterry reported something ridiculously fabulous
concerning Oliver, not unlike what Proculus did of Romulus.</p>

<p id="id00544">224 o False Heaven, &amp;c.] After the Restoration, Oliver's body
was dug up, and his head set at the farther end of Westminster-
hall, near which place there is an house of entertainment, which
is commonly known by the name of Heaven.</p>

<p id="id00545">227 p So Romulus, &amp;c.] A Roman Senator, whose name was
Proculus, and much beloved by Romulus, made oath before the
Senate, that this prince appeared to him after his death, and
predicted the future grandeur of that city, promising to be
protector of it; and expressly charged him, that he should be
adored there under the name of Quirinus; and he had his temple
on Mount Quirinale.</p>

<p id="id00546">231 q Next his Son, &amp;c.] Oliver's eldest son Richard was, by
him before his death, declared his successor; and, by order of
privy-council, proclaimed Lord Protector, and received the
compliments of congratulation and condolence, at the same
time, from the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen: and
addresses were presented to him from all parts of the nation,
promising to stand by him with their lives and fortunes. He
summoned a Parliament to meet at Westminster, which
recognized him Lord Protector: yet, notwithstanding,
Fleetwood, Desborough, and their partizans, managed affairs
so, that he was obliged to resign.</p>

<p id="id00547">245 r To edify upon the Ruins, &amp;c.] John of Leyden, whose
name was Buckhold, was a butcher of the same place, but a
crafty, eloquent, and seditious fellow and one of those called
Anabaptists. He went and set up at Munster, where, with
Knipperdoling, and others of the same faction, they spread their
abominable errors, and run about the streets in enthusiastical
raptures, crying, Repent and be baptized, pronouncing dismal
woes against all those that would not embrace their tenets.
About the year 1533 they broke out into an open insurrection,
and seized the palace and magazines, and grew so formidable
that it was very dangerous for those who were not of their
persuasion to dwell in Munster; but at length he and his
associates being subdued and taken, he was executed at
Munster, had his flesh pulled off by two executioners with red-
hot pincers for the space of an hour, and then run through with a
sword.</p>

<p id="id00548">351 s 'Mong these there was a Politician, &amp;c.] This was the
famous E. of S. who was endued with a particular faculty of
undermining and subverting all sorts of government.</p>

<p id="id00549">409 t and better than by Napier's Bones, &amp;c.] The famous Lord
Napier, of Scotland, the first inventor of logarithms, contrived
also a set of square pieces, with numbers on them, made
generally of ivory, (which perform arithmetical and geometrical
calculations,) and are commonly called Napier's Bones.</p>

<p id="id00550">421 u To match this Saint, &amp;c.] The great colonel John
Lilbourn, whose trial is so remarkable, and well known at this
time.</p>

<p id="id00551">475 w The Trojan Mare, &amp;c.] After the Grecians had spent ten
years in the siege of Troy, without the least prospect of success,
they bethought of a stratagem, and made a wooden horse
capable of containing a considerable number of armed men: this
they filled with the choicest of their army, and then pretended to
raise the siege; upon which the credulous Trojans made a
breach in the walls of the city to bring in this fatal plunder; but
when it was brought in, the inclosed heroes soon appeared, and
surprizing the city, the rest entered in at the breach.</p>

<p id="id00552">520 x (I mean Margaret's Fast) &amp;c.] That Parliament used to
have publick fasts kept in St. Margaret's church, Westminster,
as is done to this present time.</p>

<p id="id00553">605 y To hang like Mahomet, &amp;c.] It is reported of Mahomet
the great impostor, that having built a mosque, the roof whereof
was of loadstone, and ordering his corpse, when he was dead, to
be put into an iron coffin, and brought into that place, the
loadstone soon attracted it near the top, where it still hangs in
the air.
No less fabulous is what the legend says of Ignatius Loyola, that
his zeal and devotion transported him so, that at his prayers he
has been seen to be raised from the ground for some
considerable time together.</p>

<p id="id00554">650 z As easy as Serpents, &amp;c.] Naturalists report, that Snakes,
Serpents, &amp;c. cast their skins every year.</p>

<p id="id00555">655 a As Barnacles turn Soland Geese, &amp;c.] It is said that in the
Islands of the Orcades, in Scotland, there are trees which bear
those barnacles, which dropping off into the water, receive life,
and become those birds called soland geese.</p>

<p id="id00556">663 b So he that keeps the Gate of Hell, &amp;c.] The poets feign
the dog Cerberus, that is the porter of hell, to have three heads.</p>

<p id="id00557">685 c The GIBELLINES, &amp;c.] Two great factions in Italy,
distinguished by those names, miserably distracted and wasted
it about the year 1130.</p>

<p id="id00558">841 d When three Saints Ears, &amp;c.] Burton, Prynn, and
Bastwick, three notorious ringleaders of the factious, just at the
beginning of the late horrid rebellion.</p>

<p id="id00559">894 e But Fisher's Folly, &amp;c.] Fisher's Folly, was where
Devonshire-Square now stands, and was a great place of
consultation in those days.</p>

<p id="id00560">907 f Cut out more Work, &amp;c.] Plato's year, or the grand
revolution of the intire machine of the world, was accounted
4000 years.</p>

<p id="id00561">1200 g T' your great Croysado General, &amp;c.] General Fairfax,
who was soon laid aside after he had done some of their
drudgery for them.</p>

<p id="id00562">1241 h To pass for deep and learned Scholars, &amp;c.] Two
ridiculous scribblers, that were often pestering the world with
nonsense.</p>

<p id="id00563">1250 i Like Sir Pride, &amp;c.] The one a brewer, the other a
shoemaker, and both colonels in the rebels' army.</p>

<p id="id00564">1505 k The beastly Rabble that came down, &amp;c.] This is an
accurate description of the mob's burning rumps upon the
admission of the secluded Members, on contempt of the Rump-
Parliament.</p>

<p id="id00565">1534 l Be ready listed under DON] The hangman's name at that
time was Don.</p>

<p id="id00566">1550 m They've roasted COOK already and PRIDE in.] Cook
acted as solicitor-general against King Charles the First at his
trial; and afterwards received his just reward for the same.
Pride, a colonel in the Parliament's army.</p>

<p id="id00567">1564 n Their Founder was a blown up Soldier.] Ignatius Loyola,
the founder of the society of the Jesuits, was a gentleman of
Biscay, in Spain, and bred a soldier; was at Pampelune when it
was besieged by the French in the year 1521, and was so very
lame in both feet, by the damage he sustained there, that he was
forced to keep his bed.</p>

<p id="id00568">1585 o And from their Coptick Priests, Kircherus.] Athanasius
Kircher, a Jesuit, hath wrote largely on the AEgyptian mystical
learning.</p>

<p id="id00569"> 1587 p For, as the AEgyptians us'd by Bees, &amp;c.] The
AEgyptians represented their kings, (many of whose names
were Ptolemy) under the hieroglyphick of a bee, dispensing
honey to the good and virtuous, and having a sting for the
wicked and dissolute.</p>
