<p>WHO wou'd believe what strange bugbears<br/>

Mankind creates itself of fears<br/>

That spring like fern, that insect weed,<br/>

Equivocally, without seed;<br/>

And have no possible foundation,                                5<br/>

But merely in th' imagination;<br/>

And yet can do more dreadful feats<br/>

Than hags, with all their imps and teats<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-198" id="noteref-198" epub:type="noteref">198</a><br/>

Make more bewitch and haunt themselves<br/>

Than all their nurseries of elves?                             10<br/>

For fear does things so like a witch,<br/>

'Tis hard t' unriddle which is which:<br/>

Sets up Communities of senses,<br/>

To chop and change intelligences;<br/>

As Rosicrucian virtuosos<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-199" id="noteref-199" epub:type="noteref">199</a>                                   15<br/>

Can see with ears, and hear with noses;<br/>

And when they neither see nor hear,<br/>

Have more than both supply'd by fear<br/>

That makes 'em in the dark see visions,<br/>

And hag themselves with apparitions;                           20<br/>

And when their eyes discover least,<br/>

Discern the subtlest objects best<br/>

Do things not contrary, alone,<br/>

To th' course of nature, but its own;<br/>

The courage of the bravest daunt,                              25<br/>

And turn poltroons as valiant:<br/>

For men as resolute appear<br/>

With too much as too little fear<br/>

And when they're out of hopes of flying,<br/>

Will run away from death by dying;                             30<br/>

Or turn again to stand it out,<br/>

And those they fled, like lions, rout.<br/>
</p>

<p>This HUDIBRAS had prov'd too true,<br/>

Who, by the furies left perdue,<br/>

And haunted with detachments, sent                             35<br/>

From Marshal Legion's regiment,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-200" id="noteref-200" epub:type="noteref">200</a><br/>

Was by a fiend, as counterfeit,<br/>

Reliev'd and rescu'd with a cheat;<br/>

When nothing but himself, and fear,<br/>

Was both the imp and conjurer;                                 40<br/>

As, by the rules o' th' virtuosi,<br/>

It follows in due form of poesie.<br/>
</p>

<p>Disguis'd in all the masks of night,<br/>

We left our champion on his flight,<br/>

At blind man's buff, to grope his way,                         45<br/>

In equal fear of night and day,<br/>

Who took his dark and desp'rate course,<br/>

He knew no better than his horse;<br/>

And, by an unknown Devil led,<br/>

(He knew as little whither,) fled.                             50<br/>

He never was in greater need,<br/>

Nor less capacity, of speed;<br/>

Disabled, both in man and beast,<br/>

To fly and run away his best;<br/>

To keep the enemy, and fear,                                   55<br/>

From equal falling on his rear.<br/>

And though with kicks and bangs he ply'd<br/>

The further and the nearer side,<br/>

(As seamen ride with all their force,<br/>

And tug as if they row'd the horse,                            60<br/>

And when the hackney sails most swift,<br/>

Believe they lag, or run a-drift,)<br/>

So, though he posted e'er so fast,<br/>

His fear was greater than his haste:<br/>

For fear, though fleeter than the wind,                        65<br/>

Believes 'tis always left behind.<br/>

But when the morn began t' appear,<br/>

And shift t' another scene his fear,<br/>

He found his new officious shade,<br/>

That came so timely to his aid,                                70<br/>

And forc'd him from the foe t' escape,<br/>

Had turn'd itself to RALPHO's shape;<br/>

So like in person, garb, and pitch,<br/>

'Twas hard t' interpret which was which.<br/>
</p>

<p>For RALPHO had no sooner told                                  75<br/>

The Lady all he had t' unfold,<br/>

But she convey'd him out of sight,<br/>

To entertain the approaching Knight;<br/>

And, while he gave himself diversion,<br/>

T' accommodate his beast and person,                           80<br/>

And put his beard into a posture<br/>

At best advantage to accost her,<br/>

She order'd th' anti-masquerade<br/>

(For his reception) aforesaid:<br/>

But when the ceremony was done,                                85<br/>

The lights put out, and furies gone,<br/>

And HUDIBRAS, among the rest,<br/>

Convey'd away, as RALPHO guess'd,<br/>

The wretched caitiff, all alone,<br/>

(As he believ'd) began to moan,                                90<br/>

And tell his story to himself,<br/>

The Knight mistook him for an elf;<br/>

And did so still till he began<br/>

To scruple at RALPH's Outward Man;<br/>

And thought, because they oft agreed                           95<br/>

T' appear in one another's stead,<br/>

And act the Saint's and Devil's part<br/>

With undistinguishable art,<br/>

They might have done so now, perhaps,<br/>

And put on one another's shapes                               100<br/>

And therefore, to resolve the doubt,<br/>

He star'd upon him, and cry'd out,<br/>

What art? My 'Squire, or that bold Sprite<br/>

That took his place and shape to-night?<br/>

Some busy indepenent pug,                                     105<br/>

Retainer to his Synagogue?<br/>

Alas! quoth he, I'm none of those,<br/>

Your bosom friends, as you suppose;<br/>

But RALPH himself, your trusty 'Squire,<br/>

Wh' has dragg'd your Dunship out o' th' mire,                 110<br/>

And from th' inchantments of a widow,<br/>

Wh' had turn'd you int' a beast, have freed you;<br/>

And, though a prisoner of war,<br/>

Have brought you safe where you now are;<br/>

Which you would gratefully repay                              115<br/>

Your constant Presbyterian way.<br/>
</p>

<p>That's stranger (quoth the Knight) and stranger.<br/>

Who gave thee notice of my danger?<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, Th' infernal Conjurer<br/>

Pursu'd and took me prisoner;                                 120<br/>

And knowing you were hereabout,<br/>

Brought me along to find you out;<br/>

Where I, in hugger-mugger hid,<br/>

Have noted all they said or did:<br/>

And though they lay to him the pageant,                       125<br/>

I did not see him, nor his agent;<br/>

Who play'd their sorceries out of sight,<br/>

T' avoid a fiercer second fight.<br/>

But didst thou see no Devils then?<br/>

Not one (quoth he) but carnal men,                            130<br/>

A little worse than fiends in hell,<br/>

And that She-Devil Jezebel,<br/>

That laugh'd and tee-he'd with derision,<br/>

To see them take your deposition.<br/>
</p>

<p>What then (quoth HUDIBRAS) was he                             135<br/>

That play'd the Dev'l to examine me?<br/>

A rallying weaver in the town,<br/>

That did it in a parson's gown;<br/>

Whom all the parish take for gifted;<br/>

But, for my part, I ne'er believ'd it:                        140<br/>

In which you told them all your feats,<br/>

Your conscientious frauds and cheats;<br/>

Deny'd your whipping, and confest<br/>

The naked truth of all the rest,<br/>

More plainly than the Rev'rend Writer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-201" id="noteref-201" epub:type="noteref">201</a>                    145<br/>

That to our Churches veil'd his Mitre;<br/>

All which they took in black and white,<br/>

And cudgell'd me to under-write.<br/>
</p>

<p>What made thee, when they all were gone,<br/>

And none but thou and I alone,                                150<br/>

To act the Devil, and forbear<br/>

To rid me of my hellish fear?<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, I knew your constant rate<br/>

And frame of sp'rit too obstinate<br/>

To be by me prevail'd upon                                    155<br/>

With any motives of my own;<br/>

And therefore strove to counterfeit<br/>

The Dev'l a-while, to nick your wit;<br/>

The Devil, that is your constant crony,<br/>

That only can prevail upon ye;                                160<br/>

Else we might still have been disputing,<br/>

And they with weighty drubs confuting.<br/>
</p>

<p>The Knight who now began to find<br/>

Th' had left the enemy behind,<br/>

And saw no farther harm remain,                               165<br/>

But feeble weariness and pain;<br/>

Perceiv'd, by losing of their way,<br/>

Th' had gain'd th' advantage of the day;<br/>

And, by declining of the road,<br/>

They had, by chance, their rear made good;                    170<br/>

He ventur'd to dismiss his fear,<br/>

That parting's wont to rent and tear,<br/>

And give the desperat'st attack<br/>

To danger still behind its back.<br/>

For having paus'd to recollect,                               175<br/>

And on his past success reflect,<br/>

T' examine and consider why,<br/>

And whence, and how, they came to fly,<br/>

And when no Devil had appear'd,<br/>

What else, it cou'd be said, he fear'd;                       180<br/>

It put him in so fierce a rage,<br/>

He once resolv'd to re-engage;<br/>

Toss'd like a foot-ball back again,<br/>

With shame and vengeance, and disdain.<br/>

Quoth he, it was thy cowardice                                185<br/>

That made me from this leaguer rise<br/>

And when I'd half reduc'd the place,<br/>

To quit it infamously base<br/>

Was better cover'd by the new<br/>

Arriv'd detachment then I knew;                               190<br/>

To slight my new acquests, and run<br/>

Victoriously from battles won;<br/>

And reck'ning all I gain'd or lost,<br/>

To sell them cheaper than they cost;<br/>

To make me put myself to flight,                              195<br/>

And conqu'ring run away by night<br/>

To drag me out, which th' haughty foe<br/>

Durst never have presum'd to do<br/>

To mount me in the dark, by force,<br/>

Upon the bare ridge of my horse;                              200<br/>

Expos'd in querpo to their rage,<br/>

Without my arms and equipage;<br/>

Lest, if they ventur'd to pursue,<br/>

I might th' unequal fight renew;<br/>

And, to preserve thy Outward Man,                             205<br/>

Assum'd my place, and led the van.<br/>
</p>

<p>All this quoth RALPH, I did, 'tis true,<br/>

Not to preserve my self, but you;<br/>

You, who were damn'd to baser drubs<br/>

Than wretches feel in powd'ring tubs.                         210<br/>

To mount two-wheel'd carroches, worse<br/>

Than managing a wooden-horse<br/>

Dragg'd out through straiter holes by th' ears,<br/>

Eras'd or coup'd for perjurers;<br/>

Who, though th' attempt had prov'd in vain,                   215<br/>

Had had no reason to complain:<br/>

But since it prosper'd, 'tis unhandsome<br/>

To blame the hand that paid our ransome,<br/>

And rescu'd your obnoxious bones<br/>

From unavoidable battoons.                                    220<br/>

The enemy was reinforc'd,<br/>

And we disabled, and unhors'd,<br/>

Disarm'd, unqualify'd for fight,<br/>

And no way left but hasty flight,<br/>

Which though as desp'rate in th' attempt,                     225<br/>

Has giv'n you freedom to condemn't.<br/>

But were our bones in fit condition<br/>

To reinforce the expedition,<br/>

'Tis now unseasonable, and vain,<br/>

To think of falling on again.                                 230<br/>

No martial project to surprize<br/>

Can ever be attempted twice;<br/>

Nor cast design serve afterwards,<br/>

As gamesters tear their losing-cards,<br/>

Beside, our bangs of man and beast                            235<br/>

Are fit for nothing now but rest;<br/>

And for a-while will not be able<br/>

To rally, and prove serviceable;<br/>

And therefore I, with reason, chose<br/>

This stratagem t' amuse our foes;                             240<br/>

To make an honourable retreat,<br/>

And wave a total sure defeat;<br/>

For those that fly may fight again,<br/>

Which he can never do that's slain.<br/>

Hence timely running's no mean part                           245<br/>

Of conduct in the martial art;<br/>

By which some glorious feats atchieve,<br/>

As citizens by breaking thrive;<br/>

And cannons conquer armies, while<br/>

They seem to draw off and recoil;                             250<br/>

Is held the gallantest course, and bravest<br/>

To great exploits, as well as safest;<br/>

That spares th' expence of time and pains,<br/>

And dangerous beating out of brains;<br/>

And in the end prevails as certain                            255<br/>

As those that never trust to fortune;<br/>

But make their fear do execution<br/>

Beyond the stoutest resolution;<br/>

As earthquakes kill without a blow,<br/>

And, only trembling, overthrow,                               260<br/>

If th' ancients crown'd their bravest men<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-202" id="noteref-202" epub:type="noteref">202</a><br/>

That only sav'd a citizen,<br/>

What victory could e'er be won,<br/>

If ev'ry one would save but one<br/>

Or fight endanger'd to be lost,                               265<br/>

Where all resolve to save the most?<br/>

By this means, when a battle's won,<br/>

The war's as far from being done;<br/>

For those that save themselves, and fly,<br/>

Go halves, at least, i' th' victory;                          270<br/>

And sometimes, when the loss is small,<br/>

And danger great, they challenge all;<br/>

Print new additions to their feats,<br/>

And emendations in Gazettes;<br/>

And when, for furious haste to run,                           275<br/>

They durst not stay to fire a gun,<br/>

Have done't with bonfires, and at home<br/>

Made squibs and crackers overcome;<br/>

To set the rabble on a flame,<br/>

And keep their governors from blame;                          280<br/>

Disperse the news the pulpit tells,<br/>

Confirm'd with fire-works and with bells;<br/>

And though reduc'd to that extream,<br/>

They have been forc'd to sing Te Deum;<br/>

Yet, with religious blasphemy,                                285<br/>

By flattering Heaven with a lie<br/>

And for their beating giving thanks,<br/>

Th' have rais'd recruits, and fill'd their banks;<br/>

For those who run from th' enemy,<br/>

Engage them equally to fly;                                   290<br/>

And when the fight becomes a chace,<br/>

Those win the day that win the race<br/>

And that which would not pass in fights,<br/>

Has done the feat with easy flights;<br/>

Recover'd many a desp'rate campaign                           295<br/>

With Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Champaign;<br/>

Restor'd the fainting high and mighty<br/>

With brandy-wine and aqua-vitae;<br/>

And made 'em stoutly overcome<br/>

With bachrach, hoccamore, and mum;                            300<br/>

Whom the uncontroul'd decrees of fate<br/>

To victory necessitate;<br/>

With which, although they run or burn<br/>

They unavoidably return:<br/>

Or else their sultan populaces                            305<br/>

Still strangle all their routed Bassas.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-203" id="noteref-203" epub:type="noteref">203</a><br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth HUDIBRAS, I understand<br/>

What fights thou mean'st at sea and land,<br/>

And who those were that run away,<br/>

And yet gave out th' had won the day;                         310<br/>

Although the rabble sous'd them for't,<br/>

O'er head and ears in mud and dirt.<br/>

'Tis true, our modern way of war<br/>

Is grown more politick by far,<br/>

But not so resolute, and bold,                                315<br/>

Nor ty'd to honour, as the old.<br/>

For now they laugh at giving battle,<br/>

Unless it be to herds of cattle;<br/>

Or fighting convoys of provision,<br/>

The whole design o' the expedition:                           320<br/>

And not with downright blows to rout<br/>

The enemy, but eat them out:<br/>

As fighting, in all beasts of prey,<br/>

And eating, are perform'd one way,<br/>

To give defiance to their teeth                               325<br/>

And fight their stubborn guts to death;<br/>

And those atchieve the high'st renown,<br/>

That bring the others' stomachs down,<br/>

There's now no fear of wounds, nor maiming;<br/>

All dangers are reduc'd to famine;                            330<br/>

And feats of arms, to plot, design,<br/>

Surprize, and stratagem, and mine;<br/>

But have no need nor use of courage,<br/>

Unless it be for glory or forage:<br/>

For if they fight, 'tis but by chance,                        335<br/>

When one side vent'ring to advance,<br/>

And come uncivilly too near,<br/>

Are charg'd unmercifully i' th' rear;<br/>

And forc'd with terrible resistance,<br/>

To keep hereafter at a distance;                              340<br/>

To pick out ground to incamp upon,<br/>

Where store of largest rivers run,<br/>

That serve, instead of peaceful barriers,<br/>

To part th' engagements of their warriors;<br/>

Where both from side to side may skip,                        345<br/>

And only encounter at bo-peep:<br/>

For men are found the stouter-hearted,<br/>

The certainer th' are to be parted,<br/>

And therefore post themselves in bogs,<br/>

As th' ancient mice attack'd the frogs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-204" id="noteref-204" epub:type="noteref">204</a>                   350<br/>

And made their mortal enemy,<br/>

The water-rat, their strict ally.<br/>

For 'tis not now, who's stout and bold,<br/>

But who bears hunger best, and cold;<br/>

And he's approv'd the most deserving,                         355<br/>

Who longest can hold out at starving;<br/>

And he that routs most pigs and cows,<br/>

The formidablest man of prowess.<br/>

So th' emperor CALIGULA,<br/>

That triumph'd o'er the British Sea,                          360<br/>

Took crabs and oysters prisoners,<br/>

Lobsters, 'stead of cuirasiers,<br/>

Engag'd his legions in fierce bustles<br/>

With periwinkles, prawns, and muscles;<br/>

And led his troops with furious gallops,                      365<br/>

To charge whole regiments of scallops<br/>

Not like their ancient way of war,<br/>

To wait on his triumphal carr<br/>

But when he went to dine or sup<br/>

More bravely eat his captives up;                             370<br/>

And left all war, by his example,<br/>

Reduc'd to vict'ling of a camp well.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth RALPH, By all that you have said,<br/>

And twice as much that I cou'd add,<br/>

'Tis plain you cannot now do worse,                           375<br/>

Than take this out-of-fashion'd course;<br/>

To hope, by stratagem, to woo her,<br/>

Or waging battle to subdue her<br/>

Though some have done it in romances,<br/>

And bang'd them into amorous fancies;                         380<br/>

As those who won the AMAZONS,<br/>

By wanton drubbing of their bones;<br/>

And stout Rinaldo gain'd his bride,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-205" id="noteref-205" epub:type="noteref">205</a><br/>

By courting of her back and side.<br/>

But since those times and feats are over,                     385<br/>

They are not for a modern lover,<br/>

When mistresses are too cross-grain'd<br/>

By such addresses to be gain'd;<br/>

And if they were, wou'd have it out<br/>

With many another kind of bout.                               390<br/>

Therefore I hold no course s' infeasible,<br/>

As this of force to win the JEZEBEL;<br/>

To storm her heart, by th' antick charms<br/>

Of ladies errant, force of arms;<br/>

But rather strive by law to win her,                          395<br/>

And try the title you have in her.<br/>

Your case is clear; you have her word,<br/>

And me to witness the accord<br/>

Besides two more of her retinue<br/>

To testify what pass'd between you;                           400<br/>

More probable, and like to hold,<br/>

Than hand, or seal, or breaking gold;<br/>

For which so many, that renounc'd<br/>

Their plighted contracts, have been trounc'd<br/>

And bills upon record been found,                             405<br/>

That forc'd the ladies to compound;<br/>

And that, unless I miss the matter,<br/>

Is all the bus'ness you look after.<br/>

Besides, encounters at the bar<br/>

Are braver now than those in war,                             410<br/>

In which the law does execution<br/>

With less disorder and confusion<br/>

Has more of honour in't, some hold<br/>

Not like the new way, but the old<br/>

When those the pen had drawn together,                        415<br/>

Decided quarrels with the feather,<br/>

And winged arrows kill'd as dead,<br/>

And more than bullets now of lead.<br/>

So all their combats now, as then,<br/>

Are manag'd chiefly by the pen;                               420<br/>

That does the feat with braver vigours,<br/>

In words at length, as well as figures;<br/>

Is judge of all the world performs<br/>

In voluntary feats of arms<br/>

And whatsoe'er's atchiev'd in fight,                          425<br/>

Determines which is wrong or right:<br/>

For whether you prevail, or lose<br/>

All must be try'd there in the close;<br/>

And therefore  'tis not wise to shun<br/>

What you must trust to ere y' have done.                      430<br/>
</p>

<p>The law, that settles all you do,<br/>

And marries where you did but woo;<br/>

That makes the most perfidious lover<br/>

A lady, that's as false, recover;<br/>

And if it judge upon your side,                               435<br/>

Will soon extend her for your bride;<br/>

And put her person, goods, or lands,<br/>

Or which you like best int' your hands.<br/>
</p>

<p>For law's the wisdom of all ages,<br/>

And manag'd by the ablest sages;                              440<br/>

Who, though their bus'ness at the bar<br/>

Be but a kind of civil war,<br/>

In which th' engage with fiercer dudgeons<br/>

Than e'er the GRECIANS did and TROJANS,<br/>

They never manage the contest                                 445<br/>

T' impair their public interest;<br/>

Or by their controversies lessen<br/>

The dignity of their profession:<br/>

Not like us Brethren, who divide<br/>

Our Commonwealth, the Cause, and Side;                        450<br/>

And though w' are all as near of kindred<br/>

As th' outward man is to the inward,<br/>

We agree in nothing, but to wrangle<br/>

About the slightest fingle-fangle;<br/>

While lawyers have more sober sense                           455<br/>

Than t' argue at their own expence,<br/>

But make their best advantages<br/>

Of others' quarrels, like the Swiss;<br/>

And, out of foreign controversies,<br/>

By aiding both sides, fill their purses;                      460<br/>

But have no int'rest in the cause<br/>

For which th' engage, and wage the laws;<br/>

Nor further prospect than their pay,<br/>

Whether they lose or win the day:<br/>

And though th' abounded in all ages,                          465<br/>

With sundry learned clerks and sages,<br/>

Though all their business be dispute,<br/>

Which way they canvass ev'ry suit,<br/>

Th' have no disputes about their art,<br/>

Nor in Polemicks controvert:                                  470<br/>

While all professions else are found<br/>

With nothing but disputes t' abound<br/>

Divines of all sorts, and physicians,<br/>

Philosophers, mathematicians:<br/>

The Galenist and Paracelsian                                  475<br/>

Condemn the way each other deals in:<br/>

Anatomists dissect and mangle,<br/>

To cut themselves out work to wrangle<br/>

Astrologers dispute their dreams,<br/>

That in their sleeps they talk of schemes:                    480<br/>

And heralds stickle, who got who<br/>

So many hundred years ago.<br/>
</p>

<p>But lawyers are too wise a nation<br/>

T' expose their trade to disputation;<br/>

Or make the busy rabble judges                                485<br/>

Of all their secret piques and grudges;<br/>

In which whoever wins the day,<br/>

The whole profession's sure to pay.<br/>

Beside, no mountebanks, nor cheats,<br/>

Dare undertake to do their feats,                             490<br/>

When in all other sciences<br/>

They swarm, like insects, and increase.<br/>
</p>

<p>For what bigot durst ever draw,<br/>

By inward light, a deed in law?<br/>

Or could hold forth, by revelation,                           495<br/>

An answer to a declaration?<br/>

For those that meddle with their tools<br/>

Will cut their fingers, if they're fools;<br/>

And if you follow their advice,<br/>

In bills, and answers, and replies,                           500<br/>

They'll write a love-letter in chancery,<br/>

Shall bring her upon oath to answer ye,<br/>

And soon reduce her to b' your wife,<br/>

Or make her weary of her life.<br/>
</p>

<p>The Knight, who us'd with tricks and shifts                   505<br/>

To edify by RALPHO's Gifts,<br/>

But in appearance cry'd him down,<br/>

To make them better seem his own,<br/>

(All Plagiaries' constant course<br/>

Of sinking when they take a purse),                           510<br/>

Resolv'd to follow his advice,<br/>

But kept it from him by disguise;<br/>

And, after stubborn contradiction,<br/>

To counterfeit his own conviction,<br/>

And by transition fall upon                                   515<br/>

The resolution as his own.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, This gambol thou advisest<br/>

Is of all others the unwisest;<br/>

For if I think by law to gain her,<br/>

There's nothing sillier or vainer                             520<br/>

'Tis but to hazard my pretence,<br/>

Where nothing's certain, but th' expence;<br/>

To act against myself, and traverse<br/>

My suit and title, to her favours<br/>

And if she shou'd (which Heav'n forbid)                       525<br/>

O'erthrow me, as the fidler did,<br/>

What aftercourse have I to take,<br/>

'Gainst losing all I have at stake?<br/>

He that with injury is griev'd,<br/>

And goes to law to be reliev'd,                               530<br/>

Is sillier than a sottish chowse,<br/>

Who, when thief has robb'd his house,<br/>

Applies himself to cunning men,<br/>

To help him to his goods agen;<br/>

When all he can expect to gain,                               535<br/>

Is but to squander more in vain;<br/>

And yet I have no other way<br/>

But is as difficult to play.<br/>

For to reduce her by main force,<br/>

Is now in vain; by fair means, worse;                         540<br/>

But worst of all, to give her over,<br/>

'Till she's as desp'rate to recover<br/>

For bad games are thrown up too soon,<br/>

Until th' are never to be won.<br/>

But since I have no other course,                             545<br/>

But is as bad t' attempt, or worse,<br/>

He that complies against his will,<br/>

Is of his own opinion still;<br/>

Which he may adhere to, yet disown,<br/>

For reasons to himself best known:                            550<br/>

But 'tis not to b' avoided now,<br/>

For SIDROPHEL resolves to sue;<br/>

Whom I must answer, or begin<br/>

Inevitably first with him.<br/>

For I've receiv'd advertisement,                              555<br/>

By times enough, of his intent;<br/>

And knowing he that first complains<br/>

Th' advantage of the business gains;<br/>

For Courts of Justice understand<br/>

The plaintiff to be eldest hand;                              560<br/>

Who what he pleases may aver;<br/>

The other, nothing, till he swear;<br/>

Is freely admitted to all grace,<br/>

And lawful favour, by his place;<br/>

And, for his bringing custom in,                              565<br/>

Has all advantages to win.<br/>

I, who resolve to oversee<br/>

No lucky opportunity,<br/>

Will go to council, to advise<br/>

Which way t' encounter, or surprize,                          570<br/>

And, after long consideration,<br/>

Have found out one to fit th' occasion;<br/>

Most apt for what I have to do,<br/>

As counsellor and justice too.<br/>

And truly so, no doubt, he was,                               575<br/>

A lawyer fit for such a case.<br/>
</p>

<p>An old dull sot, who told the clock<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-206" id="noteref-206" epub:type="noteref">206</a><br/>

For many years at Bridewell-dock,<br/>

At Westminster, and Hicks's-Hall,<br/>

And Hiccius Doctius play'd in all;                            580<br/>

Where, in all governments and times,<br/>

H' had been both friend and foe to crimes,<br/>

And us'd two equal ways of gaining<br/>

By hind'ring justice or maintaining;<br/>

To many a whore gave priviledge,                              585<br/>

And whipp'd for want of quarteridge:<br/>

Cart-loads of bawds to prison sent<br/>

For b'ing behind a fortnight's rent<br/>

And many a trusty pimp and croney<br/>

To Puddle-dock for want of money;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-207" id="noteref-207" epub:type="noteref">207</a>                         590<br/>

Engag'd the constable to seize<br/>

All those that would not break the peace,<br/>

Nor give him back his own foul words,<br/>

Though sometimes Commoners or Lords,<br/>

And kept 'em prisoners of course,                             595<br/>

For being sober at ill hours;<br/>

That in the morning he might free<br/>

Or bind 'em over for his fee;<br/>

Made monsters fine, and puppet-plays,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-208" id="noteref-208" epub:type="noteref">208</a><br/>

For leave to practise in their ways;                          600<br/>

Farm'd out all cheats, and went a share<br/>

With th' headborough and scavenger;<br/>

And made the dirt i' th' streets compound<br/>

For taking up the publick ground;<br/>

The kennel, and the King's highway,                           605<br/>

For being unmolested, pay;<br/>

Let out the stocks, and whipping-post,<br/>

And cage, to those that gave him most;<br/>

Impos'd a tax on bakers' ears,<br/>

And for false weights on chandelers;                          610<br/>

Made victuallers and vintners fine<br/>

For arbitrary ale and wine;<br/>

But was a kind and constant friend<br/>

To all that regularly offend;<br/>

As residentiary bawds,                                        615<br/>

And brokers that receive stol'n goods;<br/>

That cheat in lawful mysteries,<br/>

And pay church duties and his fees;<br/>

But was implacable, and awkward,<br/>

To all that interlop'd and hawker'd.                          620<br/>
</p>

<p>To this brave man the Knight repairs<br/>

For council in his law-affairs<br/>

And found him mounted in his pew,<br/>

With books and money plac'd for shew,<br/>

Like nest-eggs to make clients lay,                           625<br/>

And for his false opinion pay<br/>

To whom the knight, with comely grace,<br/>

Put off his hat to put his case<br/>

Which he as proudly entertain'd<br/>

As th' other courteously strain'd;                            630<br/>

And, to assure him 't was not that<br/>

He look'd for, bid him put on's hat.<br/>
</p>

<p>Quoth he, There is one SIDROPHEL,<br/>

Whom I have cudgell'd — Very well.<br/>

And now he brags t' have beaten me. —                        635<br/>

Better and better still, quoth he. —<br/>

And vows to stick me to a wall<br/>

Where-e'er he meets me — Best of all.<br/>

'Tis true, the knave has taken's oath<br/>

That I robb'd him — Well done, in troth                      640<br/>

When h' has confess'd he stole my cloak,<br/>

And pick'd my fob, and what he took;<br/>

Which was the cause that made me bang him,<br/>

And take my goods again — Marry hang him.<br/>

Now whether I should before-hand,                             645<br/>

Swear he robb'd me? — I understand.<br/>

Or bring my action of conversion<br/>

And trover for my goods? — Ah, Whoreson!<br/>

Or if 'tis better to indite,<br/>

And bring him to his trial? — Right.                         650<br/>

Prevent what he designs to do,<br/>

And swear for th' State against him? — True.<br/>

Or whether he that is defendant<br/>

In this case has the better end on't;<br/>

Who, putting in a new cross-bill,                             655<br/>

May traverse th' action? — Better still.<br/>

Then there's a Lady too — Aye, marry<br/>

That's easily prov'd accessary;<br/>

A widow, who, by solemn vows<br/>

Contracted to me for my spouse,                               660<br/>

Combin'd with him to break her word,<br/>

And has abetted all. — Good Lord<br/>

Suborn'd th' aforesaid SIDROPHEL<br/>

To tamper with the Dev'l of Hell;<br/>

Who put m' into a horrid fear,                                665<br/>

Fear of my life. — Make that appear.<br/>

Made an assault with fiends and men<br/>

Upon my body. — Good agen,<br/>

And kept me in a deadly fright,<br/>

And false imprisonment, all night                             670<br/>

Mean while they robb'd me, and my horse,<br/>

And stole my saddle. — Worse and worse.<br/>

And made me mount upon the bare ridge,<br/>

T' avoid a wretcheder miscarriage.<br/>
</p>

<p>Sir, quoth the Lawyer, not to flatter ye,                     675<br/>

You have as good and fair a battery<br/>

As heart can wish, and need not shame<br/>

The proudest man alive to claim.<br/>

For if th' have us'd you as you say;<br/>

Marry, quoth I, God give you joy.                             680<br/>

I wou'd it were my case, I'd give<br/>

More than I'll say, or you'll believe.<br/>

I would so trounce her, and her purse;<br/>

I'd make her kneel for better or worse;<br/>

For matrimony and hanging here                                685<br/>

Both go by destiny so clear,<br/>

That you as sure may pick and choose,<br/>

As Cross, I win; and, Pile, you lose;<br/>

And, if I durst, I would advance<br/>

As much in ready maintenance,                                 690<br/>

As upon any case I've known,<br/>

But we that practise dare not own.<br/>

The law severely contrabands<br/>

Our taking bus'ness off men's hands;<br/>

'Tis common barratry, that bears                              695<br/>

Point-blank an action 'gainst our ears<br/>

And crops them till there is not leather<br/>

To stick a pin in left of either;<br/>

For which some do the Summer-sault,<br/>

And o'er the bar, like tumblers, vault,                       700<br/>

But you may swear, at any rate,<br/>

Things not in nature, for the State;<br/>

For in all courts of justice here<br/>

A witness is not said to swear,<br/>

But make oath; that is, in plain terms,                       705<br/>

To forge whatever he affirms.<br/>
</p>

<p>(I thank you, quoth the Knight, for that,<br/>

Because 'tis to my purpose pat — )<br/>

For Justice, though she's painted blind,<br/>

Is to the weaker Side inclin'd,                               710<br/>

Like Charity; else right and wrong<br/>

Could never hold it out so long,<br/>

And, like blind Fortune, with a slight<br/>

Convey mens' interest and right<br/>

From Stiles's pocket into Nokes's,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-209" id="noteref-209" epub:type="noteref">209</a>                        715<br/>

As easily as Hocus Pocus;<br/>

Play fast and loose; make men obnoxious,<br/>

And clear again, like Hiccius Doctius.<br/>

Then whether you wou'd take her life,<br/>

Or but recover her for your wife,                             720<br/>

Or be content with what she has,<br/>

And let all other matters pass,<br/>

The bus'ness to the law's alone,<br/>

The proof is all it looks upon:<br/>

And you can want no witnesses                                 725<br/>

To swear to any thing you please,<br/>

That hardly get their mere expences<br/>

By th' labour of their consciences;<br/>

Or letting out to hire their ears<br/>

To affidavit customers,                                       730<br/>

At inconsiderable values,<br/>

To serve for jury-men or tallies,<br/>

Although retain'd in th' hardest matters,<br/>

Of trustees and administrators.<br/>
</p>

<p>For that, quoth he, let me alone;                             735<br/>

W' have store of such, and all our own;<br/>

Bred up and tutor'd by our teachers,<br/>
</p>

<p>The ablest of conscience-stretchers.<br/>

That's well, quoth he; but I should guess,<br/>

By weighing all advantages,                                   740<br/>

Your surest way is first to pitch<br/>

On BONGEY for a water-witch;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-210" id="noteref-210" epub:type="noteref">210</a><br/>

And when y' have hang'd the conjurer,<br/>

Y' have time enough to deal with her.<br/>

In th' int'rim, spare for no trepans                          745<br/>

To draw her neck into the bans<br/>

Ply her with love-letters and billets,<br/>

And bait 'em well, for quirks and quillets<br/>

With trains t' inveigle, and surprize,<br/>

Her heedless answers and replies;                             750<br/>

And if she miss the mouse-trap lines,<br/>

They'll serve for other by-designs;<br/>

And make an artist understand<br/>

To copy out her seal or hand;<br/>

Or find void places in the paper                              755<br/>

To steal in something to intrap her<br/>

Till, with her worldly goods and body,<br/>

Spight of her heart, she has endow'd ye,<br/>

Retain all sorts of witnesses,<br/>

That ply i' th' Temple under trees;                           760<br/>

Or walk the round, with knights o' th' posts,<br/>

About the cross-legg'd knights, their hosts;<br/>

Or wait for customers between<br/>

The pillars-rows in Lincoln's-Inn<br/>

Where vouchers, forgers, common-bail,                         765<br/>

And affidavit-men, ne'er fail<br/>

T' expose to sale all sorts of oaths,<br/>

According to their ears and cloaths,<br/>

Their only necessary tools,<br/>

Besides the Gospel and their souls;                           770<br/>

And when y' are furnish'd with all purveys,<br/>

I shall be ready at your service.<br/>
</p>

<p>I would not give, quoth HUDIBRAS,<br/>

A straw to understand a case,<br/>

Without the admirable skill                                   775<br/>

To wind and manage it at will;<br/>

To vere, and tack, and steer a cause<br/>

Against the weather-gage of laws;<br/>

And ring the changes upon cases<br/>

As plain as noses upon faces,                                 780<br/>

As you have well instructed me,<br/>

For which you've earn'd (here 'tis) your fee.<br/>

I long to practise your advice,<br/>

And try the subtle artifice;<br/>

To bait a letter, as you bid;                                 785<br/>

As not long after, thus he did<br/>

For having pump'd up all his wit,<br/>

And humm'd upon it, thus he writ.<br/>
