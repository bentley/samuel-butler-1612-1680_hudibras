				<h3 epub:type="title">The Lady’s Answer to the Knight</h3>
<p>THAT you're a beast, and turn'd to grass,<br/>

Is no strange news, nor ever was;<br/>

At least to me, who once you know,<br/>

Did from the pound replevin you,<br/>

When both your sword and spurs were won                         5<br/>

In combat by an Amazon.<br/>

That sword, that did (like Fate) determine<br/>

Th' inevitable death of vermine,<br/>

And never dealt its furious blows,<br/>

But cut the throats of pigs and cows,                          10<br/>

By TRULLA was, in single fight,<br/>

Disarm'd and wrested from its knight;<br/>

Your heels degraded of your spurs,<br/>

And in the stocks close prisoners;<br/>

Where still they'd lain, in base restraint,                    15<br/>

If I, in pity of your complaint,<br/>

Had not on honourable conditions,<br/>

Releast 'em from the worst of prisons<br/>

And what return that favour met<br/>

You cannot (though you wou'd) forget;                          20<br/>

When, being free, you strove t' evade<br/>

The oaths you had in prison made;<br/>

Forswore yourself; and first deny'd it,<br/>

But after own'd and justify'd it<br/>

And when y' had falsely broke one vow,                         25<br/>

Absolv'd yourself by breaking two.<br/>

For while you sneakingly submit,<br/>

And beg for pardon at our feet,<br/>

Discourag'd by your guilty fears,<br/>

To hope for quarter for your ears,                             30<br/>

And doubting 'twas in vain to sue,<br/>

You claim us boldly as your due;<br/>

Declare that treachery and force,<br/>

To deal with us, is th' only course;<br/>

We have no title nor pretence                                  35<br/>

To body, soul, or conscience;<br/>

But ought to fall to that man's share<br/>

That claims us for his proper ware.<br/>

These are the motives which, t' induce<br/>

Or fright us into love, you use.                               40<br/>

A pretty new way of gallanting,<br/>

Between soliciting and ranting;<br/>

Like sturdy beggars, that intreat<br/>

For charity at once, and threat.<br/>

But since you undertake to prove                               45<br/>

Your own propriety in love,<br/>

As if we were but lawful prize<br/>

In war between two enemies,<br/>

Or forfeitures, which ev'ry lover,<br/>

That wou'd but sue for, might recover,                         50<br/>

It is not hard to understand<br/>

The myst'ry of this bold demand,<br/>

That cannot at our persons aim,<br/>

But something capable of claim.<br/>
</p>

<p>'Tis not those paultry counterfeit                             55<br/>

French stones, which in our eyes you set,<br/>

But our right diamonds, that inspire<br/>

And set your am'rous hearts on fire.<br/>

Nor can those false St. Martin's beads,<br/>

Which on our lips you lay for reds,                            60<br/>

And make us wear, like Indian dames,<br/>

Add fuel to your scorching flames;<br/>

But those true rubies of the rock,<br/>

Which in our cabinets we lock.<br/>

'Tis not those orient pearls our teeth,                        65<br/>

That you are so transported with;<br/>

But those we wear about our necks,<br/>

Produce those amorous effects.<br/>

Nor is't those threads of gold, our hair,<br/>

The periwigs you make us wear,                                 70<br/>

But those bright guineas in our chests,<br/>

That light the wild fire in your breasts.<br/>

These love-tricks I've been vers'd in so,<br/>

That all their sly intrigues I know,<br/>

And can unriddle, by their tones,                              75<br/>

Their mystick cabals and jargones;<br/>

Can tell what passions, by their sounds,<br/>

Pine for the beauties of my grounds;<br/>

What raptures fond and amorous<br/>

O' th' charms and graces of my house;                          80<br/>

What extasy and scorching flame,<br/>

Burns for my money in my name;<br/>

What from th' unnatural desire<br/>

To beasts and cattle takes its fire;<br/>

What tender sigh, and trickling tear,                          85<br/>

Longs for a thousand pounds a year;<br/>

And languishing transports are fond<br/>

Of statute, mortgage, bill, and bond.<br/>
</p>

<p>These are th' attracts which most men fall<br/>

Inamour'd, at first sight, withal                              90<br/>

To these th' address with serenades,<br/>

And court with balls and masquerades;<br/>

And yet, for all the yearning pain<br/>

Y' have suffer'd for their loves in vain,<br/>

I fear they'll prove so nice and coy                           95<br/>

To have, and t' hold and to enjoy<br/>

That all your oaths and labour lost,<br/>

They'll ne'er turn ladies of the post.<br/>

This is not meant to disapprove<br/>

Your judgment in your choice of love;                         100<br/>

Which is so wise, the greatest part<br/>

Of mankind study 't as an art;<br/>

For love shou'd, like a deodand,<br/>

Still fall to th' owner of the land;<br/>

And where there's substance for its ground,                   105<br/>

Cannot but be more firm and sound<br/>

Than that which has the slightest basis<br/>

Of airy virtue, wit, and graces;<br/>

Which is of such thin subtlety,<br/>

It steals and creeps in at the eye,                           110<br/>

And, as it can't endure to stay,<br/>

Steals out again as nice a way.<br/>
</p>

<p>But love, that its extraction owns<br/>

From solid gold and precious stones<br/>

Must, like its shining parents, prove                         115<br/>

As solid and as glorious love.<br/>

Hence 'tis you have no way t'express<br/>

Our charms and graces but by these:<br/>

For what are lips, and eyes, and teeth,<br/>

Which beauty invades and conquers with,                       120<br/>

But rubies, pearls, and diamonds,<br/>

With which a philter-love commands?<br/>
</p>

<p>This is the way all parents prove,<br/>

In managing their childrens' love;<br/>

That force 'em t' intermarry and wed,                         125<br/>

As if th' were bur'ing of the dead;<br/>

Cast earth to earth, as in the grave,<br/>

To join in wedlock all they have:<br/>

And when the settlement's in force,<br/>

Take all the rest for better or worse;                        130<br/>

For money has a power above<br/>

The stars and fate to manage love;<br/>

Whose arrows, learned poets hold,<br/>

That never miss, are tipp'd with gold.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-217" id="noteref-217" epub:type="noteref">217</a><br/>

And though some say, the parents' claims                      135<br/>

To make love in their childrens' names,<br/>

Who many times at once provide<br/>

The nurse, the husband, and the bride<br/>

Feel darts and charms, attracts and flames,<br/>

And woo and contract in their names;                          140<br/>

And as they christen, use to marry 'em,<br/>

And, like their gossips, answer for 'em;<br/>

Is not to give in matrimony,<br/>

But sell and prostitute for money;<br/>

'Tis better than their own betrothing,                        145<br/>

Who often do't for worse than nothing;<br/>

And when th' are at their own dispose,<br/>

With greater disadvantage choose.<br/>

All this is right; but for the course<br/>

You take to do't, by fraud or force,                          150<br/>

'Tis so ridiculous, as soon<br/>

As told, 'tis never to be done;<br/>

No more than setters can betray,<br/>

That tell what tricks they are to play.<br/>

Marriage, at best, is but a vow,                              155<br/>

Which all men either break or bow:<br/>

Then what will those forbear to do,<br/>

Who perjure when they do but woo?<br/>

Such as before-hand swear and lie<br/>

For earnest to their treachery;                               160<br/>

And, rather than a crime confess,<br/>

With greater strive to make it less;<br/>

Like thieves, who, after sentence past,<br/>

Maintain their innocence to the last;<br/>

And when their crimes were made appear                        165<br/>

As plain as witnesses can swear,<br/>

Yet, when the wretches come to die,<br/>

Will take upon their death a lie,<br/>

Nor are the virtues you confest<br/>

T' your ghostly father, as you guest,                         170<br/>

So slight as to be justify'd<br/>

By being as shamefully deny'd,<br/>

As if you thought your word would pass<br/>

Point-blank on both sides of a case;<br/>

Or credit were not to be lost                                 175<br/>

B' a brave Knight-Errant of the Post,<br/>

That eats perfidiously his word,<br/>

And swears his ears through a two inch board:<br/>

Can own the same thing, and disown,<br/>

And perjure booty, Pro and Con:                               180<br/>

Can make the Gospel serve his turn,<br/>

And help him out, to be forsworn;<br/>

When 'tis laid hands upon, and kist,<br/>

To be betray'd and sold like Christ.<br/>

These are the virtues in whose name                           185<br/>

A right to all the world you claim,<br/>

And boldly challenge a dominion,<br/>

In grace and nature, o'er all women;<br/>

Of whom no less will satisfy<br/>

Than all the sex your tyranny,                                190<br/>

Although you'll find it a hard province,<br/>

With all your crafty frauds and covins,<br/>

To govern such a num'rous crew,<br/>

Who, one by one, now govern you:<br/>

For if you all were SOLOMONS,                                 195<br/>

And wise and great as he was once,<br/>

You'll find they're able to subdue<br/>

(As they did him) and baffle you.<br/>
</p>

<p>And if you are impos'd upon<br/>

'Tis by your own temptation done,                             200<br/>

That with your ignorance invite;<br/>

And teach us how to use the slight.<br/>

For when we find y' are still more taken<br/>

With false attracts of our own making;<br/>

Swear that's a rose, and that a stone,                        205<br/>

Like sots, to us that laid it on,<br/>

And what we did but slightly prime,<br/>

Most ignorantly daub in rhime;<br/>

You force us, in our own defences,<br/>

To copy beams and influences;                                 210<br/>

To lay perfections on the graces,<br/>

And draw attracts upon our faces;<br/>

And, in compliance to your wit,<br/>

Your own false jewels counterfeit.<br/>

For, by the practice of those arts                            215<br/>

We gain a greater share of hearts;<br/>

And those deserve in reason most<br/>

That greatest pains and study cost;<br/>

For great perfections are, like heaven,<br/>

Too rich a present to be given.                               220<br/>

Nor are these master-strokes of beauty<br/>

To be perform'd without hard duty,<br/>

Which, when they're nobly done and well,<br/>

The simple natural excell.<br/>

How fair and sweet the planted rose                           225<br/>

Beyond the wild in hedges grows!<br/>

For without art the noblest seeds<br/>

Of flow'rs degen'rate into weeds.<br/>

How dull and rugged, e're 'tis ground<br/>

And polish'd, looks a diamond!                                230<br/>

Though Paradise were e'er so fair,<br/>

It was not kept so without care.<br/>

The whole world, without art and dress,<br/>

Would be but one great wilderness;<br/>

And mankind but a savage herd,                                235<br/>

For all that nature has conferr'd.<br/>

This does but rough-hew, and design;<br/>

Leaves art to polish and refine.<br/>

Though women first were made for men,<br/>

Yet men were made for them agen;                              240<br/>

For when (outwitted by his wife)<br/>

Man first turn'd tenant but for life,<br/>

If women had not interven'd,<br/>

How soon had mankind had an end!<br/>

And that it is in being yet,                                  245<br/>

To us alone you are in debt.<br/>

And where's your liberty of choice,<br/>

And our unnatural No Voice?<br/>

Since all the privilege you boast,<br/>

And falsly usurp'd, or vainly lost,                           250<br/>

Is now our right; to whose creation<br/>

You owe your happy restoration:<br/>

And if we had not weighty cause<br/>

To not appear, in making laws,<br/>

We could, in spite of all your tricks,                        255<br/>

And shallow, formal politicks,<br/>

Force you our managements t' obey,<br/>

As we to yours (in shew) give way.<br/>

Hence 'tis that, while you vainly strive<br/>

T' advance your high prerogative,                             260<br/>

You basely, after all your braves,<br/>

Submit, and own yourselves our slaves;<br/>

And 'cause we do not make it known,<br/>

Nor publickly our int'rest own,<br/>

Like sots, suppose we have no shares                          265<br/>

In ord'ring you and your affairs;<br/>

When all your empire and command<br/>

You have from us at second hand<br/>

As if a pilot, that appears<br/>

To sit still only while he steers,                            270<br/>

And does not make a noise and stir<br/>

Like ev'ry common mariner,<br/>

Knew nothing of the card, nor star,<br/>

And did not guide the man of war;<br/>

Nor we, because we don't appear                               275<br/>

In councils, do not govern there;<br/>

While, like the mighty PRESTER JOHN,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-218" id="noteref-218" epub:type="noteref">218</a><br/>

Whose person none dares look upon,<br/>

But is preserv'd in close disguise,<br/>

From being made cheap to vulgar eyes,                         280<br/>

W' enjoy as large a pow'r unseen,<br/>

To govern him, as he does men;<br/>

And in the right of our Pope JOAN,<br/>

Make Emp'rors at our feet fall down;<br/>

Or JOAN DE PUCEL'S braver name,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-219" id="noteref-219" epub:type="noteref">219</a>                           285<br/>

Our right to arms and conduct claim;<br/>

Who, though a Spinster, yet was able<br/>

To serve FRANCE for a Grand Constable.<br/>
</p>

<p>We make and execute all laws;<br/>

Can judge the judges and the cause;                           290<br/>

Prescribe all rules of right or wrong<br/>

To th' long robe, and the longer tongue;<br/>

'Gainst which the world has no defence;<br/>

But our more pow'rful eloquence.<br/>

We manage things of greatest weight                           295<br/>

In all the world's affairs of state<br/>

Are ministers of war and peace,<br/>

That sway all nations how we please.<br/>

We rule all churches and their flocks,<br/>

Heretical and orthodox;                                       300<br/>

And are the heavenly vehicles<br/>

O' th' spirits in all conventicles.<br/>

By us is all commerce and trade<br/>

Improv'd, and manag'd, and decay'd;<br/>

For nothing can go off so well,                               305<br/>

Nor bears that price, as what we sell.<br/>

We rule in ev'ry publique meeting,<br/>

And make men do what we judge fitting;<br/>

Are magistrates in all great towns,<br/>

Where men do nothing but wear gowns.                          310<br/>

We make the man of war strike sail,<br/>

And to our braver conduct veil,<br/>

And, when h' has chac'd his enemies,<br/>

Submit to us upon his knees.<br/>

Is there an officer of state                                  315<br/>

Untimely rais'd, or magistrate,<br/>

That's haughty and imperious?<br/>

He's but a journeyman to us.<br/>

That as he gives us cause to do't,<br/>

Can keep him in, or turn him out.                             320<br/>
</p>

<p>We are your guardians, that increase<br/>

Or waste your fortunes how we please;<br/>

And, as you humour us, can deal<br/>

In all your matters, ill or well.<br/>
</p>

<p>'Tis we that can dispose alone,                               325<br/>

Whether your heirs shall be your own,<br/>

To whose integrity you must,<br/>

In spight of all your caution, trust;<br/>

And, 'less you fly beyond the seas,<br/>

Can fit you with what heirs we please;                        330<br/>

And force you t' own 'em, though begotten<br/>

By French Valets or Irish Footmen.<br/>

Nor can the vigorousest course<br/>

Prevail, unless to make us worse;<br/>

Who still, the harsher we are us'd,                           335<br/>

Are further off from b'ing reduc'd;<br/>

And scorn t' abate, for any ills,<br/>

The least punctilios of our wills.<br/>

Force does but whet our wits t' apply<br/>

Arts, born with us, for remedy;                               340<br/>

Which all your politicks, as yet,<br/>

Have ne'er been able to defeat:<br/>

For when y' have try'd all sorts of ways,<br/>

What fools d' we make of you in plays!<br/>

While all the favours we afford,                              345<br/>

Are but to girt you with the sword,<br/>

To fight our battles in our steads,<br/>

And have your brains beat out o' your heads;<br/>

Encounter, in despite of nature,<br/>

And fight at once, with fire and water,                       350<br/>

With pirates, rocks, and storms, and seas,<br/>

Our pride and vanity t' appease;<br/>

Kill one another, and cut throats,<br/>

For our good graces, and best thoughts;<br/>

To do your exercise for honour,                               355<br/>

And have your brains beat out the sooner;<br/>

Or crack'd, as learnedly, upon<br/>

Things that are never to be known;<br/>

And still appear the more industrious,<br/>

The more your projects are prepost'rous;                      360<br/>

To square the circle of the arts,<br/>

And run stark mad to shew your parts;<br/>

Expound the oracle of laws,<br/>

And turn them which way we see cause<br/>

Be our solicitors and agents,                                 365<br/>

And stand for us in all engagements.<br/>
</p>

<p>And these are all the mighty pow'rs<br/>

You vainly boast to cry down ours;<br/>

And what in real value's wanting,<br/>

Supply with vapouring and ranting;                            370<br/>

Because yourselves are terrify'd,<br/>

And stoop to one another's pride,<br/>

Believe we have as little wit<br/>

To be out-hector'd, and submit;<br/>

By your example, lose that right                              375<br/>

In treaties which we gain'd in fight;<br/>

And, terrify'd into an awe,<br/>

Pass on ourselves a Salique law:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-220" id="noteref-220" epub:type="noteref">220</a><br/>
</p>

<p>Or, as some nations use, give place,<br/>

And truckle to your mighty race;                              380<br/>

Let men usurp th' unjust dominion,<br/>

As if they were the better women.<br/>
